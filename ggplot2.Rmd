# Graphs with ggplot2 {#ggplot2}

## Summary

In this session, we'll first learn how to read some external data (from .xls, .xlsx, and CSV files) into R with the `readr` and `readxl` packages (both part of the `tidyverse`). 

Then, we'll write reproducible code to build graphs piece-by-piece. In Excel, graphs are made by manually selecting options - which, as we've discussed previously, may not be the best option for reproducibility. Also, if we haven't built a graph with reproducible code, then we might not be able to easily recreate a graph *or* use that code again to make the same style graph with different data.

Using `ggplot2`, the graphics package within the `tidyverse`, we'll write reproducible code to manually and thoughtfully build our graphs. 

> "ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places." - [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

So yeah...that `gg` is from "grammar of graphics."

We'll use the `ggplot2` package, but the function we use to initialize a graph will be `ggplot`, which works best for data in tidy format (i.e., a column for every variable, and a row for every observation). Graphics with `ggplot` are built step-by-step, adding new elements as layers with a plus sign (`+`) between layers (note: this is different from the pipe operator, `%>%`. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

## Getting started - In existing .Rmd, attach packages

In your existing `plots-ggplot.Rmd` from Session 2, remove everything below the first code chunk. 

The `ggplot2` package is part of the `tidyverse`, so we don't need to attach it separately. Attach the `tidyverse`, `readxl` and `here` packages in the top-most code chunk of your .Rmd. 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```

## Read in .xlsx and .csv files 

In this session, we'll use data for parks visitation from two files: 

- A comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing visitation data for all National Parks in California (ca_np.csv)
- A single Excel worksheet containing only visitation for Channel Islands National Park (ci_np.xlsx)

### `read_csv()` to read in comma-separated-value (.csv) files

There are many types of files containing data that you might want to work with in R. A common one is a comma separated value (CSV) file, which contains values with each column entry separated by a comma delimiter. CSVs can be opened, viewed, and worked with in Excel just like an .xls or .xlsx file - but let's learn how to get data directly from a CSV into R where we can work with it more reproducibly. 

To read in the ca_np.csv file, we need to: 

- insert a new code chunk
- use `read_csv()` to read in the file
- use `here()` within `read_csv()` to tell it where to look
- assign the stored data an object name (we'll store ours as ca_np)

```{r message=FALSE}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
```

Look in your Environment to see that **ca_np** now shows up. Click on the object in the Environment, and R will automatically run the `View()` function for you to pull up your data in a separate viewing tab. Now we can look at it in the spreadsheet format we're used to. 

We can explore our data frame a bit more to see what it contains. For example: 

- `names()`: to see the variable (column) names
- `head()`: to see the first *x* rows (6 is the default)
- `summary()`: see a quick summary of each variable

Cool! Next, let's read in ci_np.xlsx an Excel file) using `read_excel()`.

### `readxl` to read in Excel files 

We also have an Excel file (ci_np.xlsx) that contains observations **only** for Channel Islands National Park visitation. Both `readr` and `readxl` are part of the `tidyverse`, which means we should expect their functions to have similar syntax and structure. 

*Note: If `readxl` is part of the `tidyverse`, then why did I have to attach it separately?* Great question! Too keep the `tidyverse` manageable, there are "core" packages (`readr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `forcats`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`) that you would expect to use frequently, and those are automatically attached when you use `library(tidyverse)`. But there are *also*  more specialized `tidyverse` packages (e.g. `readxl`, `reprex`, `lubridate`, `rvest`) that are built with similar design philosophy, but are not automatically attached with `library(tidyverse)`. Those specialized packages are **installed** along with the `tidyverse`, but need to be attached individually (e.g. with `library(readxl)`). 

Use `read_excel()` to get the ci_np.xlsx data into R:

```{r, message = FALSE}
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
```

*Note: If you want to explicitly read in an .xlsx or .xls file, you can use `read_xlsx()` or `read_xls()` instead. `read_excel()` will make its best guess about which type of Excel file you're reading in, so is the generic form.*

Explore the ci_np data frame as above using functions like `View()`, `names()`, `head()`, and `summary()`.

Now that we have read in the National Parks visitation data, let's use `ggplot2` to visualize it.

## Our first ggplot graph: Visitors to Channel Islands NP

To create a bare-bones ggplot graph, we need to tell R three basic things: 

1. We're using `ggplot2::ggplot()`
2. Data we're using & variables we're plotting (i.e., what is x and/or y?)
3. What type of graph we're making (the type of *geom*)

Generally, that structure will look like this: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = df_name, aes(x = x_var_name, y = y_var_name)) +
  geom_type()
```

Breaking that down: 

- First, tell R you're using `ggplot()`
- Then, tell it the object name where variables exist (`data = df_name`)
- Next, tell it the aesthetics `aes()` to specify which variables you want to plot
- Then add a layer for the type of geom (graph type) with `geom_*()` - for example, `geom_point()` is a scatterplot, `geom_line()` is a line graph, `geom_col()` is a column graph, etc. 

Let's do that to create a line graph of visitors to Channel Islands National Park: 
```{r}
ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line()
```

We're going to be doing a lot of plot variations with those same variables. Let's store the first line as object `gg_base` so that we don't need to retype it each time: 

```{r}
gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))
```

Or, we could change that to a scatterplot just by updating the `geom_*`:
```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_point()
```

We could even do that for a column graph:
```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_col()
```

Or an area plot...
```{r}
gg_base +  
  geom_area()
```

We can see that updating to different `geom_*` types is quick, so long as the types of graphs we're switching between are compatible.

The data are there, now let's do some data viz customization. 

## Intro to customizing `ggplot` graphs

First, we'll customize some aesthetics (e.g. colors, styles, axis labels, etc.) of our graphs based on non-variable values. 

> We can change the aesthetics of elements in a ggplot graph by adding arguments within the layer where that element is created.

Some common arguments we'll use first are:

- `color = ` or `colour = `: update point or line colors
- `fill = `: update fill color for objects with areas
- `linetype = `: update the line type (dashed, long dash, etc.)
- `pch = `: update the point style 
- `size = `: update the element size (e.g. of points or line thickness)
- `alpha = `: update element opacity (1 = opaque, 0 = transparent)

Building on our first line graph, let's update the line color to "purple" and make the line type "dashed": 

```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_line(
    color = "purple",
    linetype = "dashed"
  )
```

How do we know which color names ggplot will recognize? If you google "R colors ggplot2" you'll find a lot of good resources. Here's one: [SAPE ggplot2 colors quick reference guide](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour)

Now let's update the point, style and size of points on our previous scatterplot graph using `color = `, `size = `, and `pch = ` (see `?pch` for the different point styles, which can be further customized). 

```{r}
gg_base + 
  geom_point(color = "purple",
             pch = 17,
             size = 4,
             alpha = 0.5)
```

### Activity: customize your own ggplot graph

Update one of the example graphs you created above to customize **at least** an element color and size!

## Mapping variables onto aesthetics

In the examples above, we have customized aesthetics based on constants that we input as arguments (e.g., the color / style / size isn't changing based on a variable characteristic or value). Sometimes, however, we **do** want the aesthetics of a graph to depend on a variable. To do that, we'll **map variables onto graph aesthetics**, meaning we'll change how an element on the graph looks based on a variable characteristic (usually, character or value). 

> When we want to customize a graph element based on a variable's characteristic or value, add the argument within `aes()` in the appropriate `geom_*()` layer

In short, if updating aesthetics based on a variable, make sure to put that argument inside of `aes()`. 

**Example:** Create a ggplot scatterplot graph where the **size** and **color** of the points change based on the **number of visitors**, and make all points the same level of opacity (`alpha = 0.5`). Notice the `aes()` around the `size = ` and `color = ` arguments. 

Also: this is overmapped and unnecessary. Avoid excessive / overcomplicated aesthetic mapping in data visualization.

```{r}
gg_base + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  )
```

In the example above, notice that the two arguments that **do** depend on variables are within `aes()`, but since `alpha = 0.5` doesn't depend on a variable then it is *outside the `aes()` but still within the `geom_point()` layer*. 

### Activity: map variables onto graph aesthetics

Create a column plot of Channel Islands National Park visitation over time, where the **fill color** (argument: `fill = `) changes based on the number of **visitors**. 

```{r}
gg_base + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
```

## ggplot2 complete themes

While every element of a ggplot graph is manually customizable, there are also built-in themes (`theme_*()`) that you can add to your ggplot code to make some major headway before making smaller tweaks manually. 

Here are a few to try today (but also notice all the options that appear as we start typing `theme_` into our ggplot graph code!):

- `theme_light()`
- `theme_minimal()`
- `theme_bw()`

Here, let's update our previous graph with `theme_minimal()`:
```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Updating axis labels and titles

Use `labs()` to update axis labels, and add a title and/or subtitle to your ggplot graph. 

```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_line(linetype = "dotted") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Annual park visitors",
    title = "Channel Islands NP Visitation",
    subtitle = "(1963 - 2016)"
  )
```

**Note**: If you want to update the formatting of axis values (for example, to convert to comma format instead of scientific format above), you can use the `scales` package options (see more from the [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Axes_(ggplot2)/)). 

## Combining compatible geoms

As long as the geoms are compatible, we can layer them on top of one another to further customize a graph. 

For example, adding points to a line graph: 
```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_line(color = "purple") +
  geom_point(color = "orange",
             aes(size = year),
             alpha = 0.5)
```

Or, combine a column and line graph (not sure why you'd want to do this, but you can):
```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_col(fill = "orange",
           color = "purple") +
  geom_line(color = "green")
```

## Multi-series ggplot graphs

In the examples above, we only had a single series - visitation at Channel Islands National Park. Often we'll want to visualize multiple series. For example, from the `ca_np` object we have stored, we might want to plot visitation for *all* California National Parks. 

To do that, we need to add an aesthetic that lets `ggplot` know how things are going to be grouped. A demonstration of why that's important - what happens if we *don't* let ggplot know how to group things?

```{r}
ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line()
```

Well that's definitely a mess, and it's because ggplot has no idea that these **should be different series based on the different parks that appear in the 'park_name' column**.

We can make sure R does know by adding an explicit grouping argument (`group = `), or by updating an aesthetic based on *park_name*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, group = park_name)) +
  geom_line()
```

**Note**: You could also add an aesthetic (`color = park_name`) in the `geom_line()` layer to create groupings, instead of in the topmost `ggplot()` layer.

Let's store that topmost line so that we can use it more quickly later on in the lesson:
```{r}
gg_np <- ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, group = park_name))
```

## Faceting ggplot graphs

When we facet graphs, we split them up into multiple plotting panels, where each panel contains a subset of the data. In our case, we'll split the graph above into different panels, each containing visitation data for a single park. 

Also notice that any general theme changes made will be applied to *all* of the graphs. 

```{r}
gg_np +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "year", y = "annual visitors") +
  facet_wrap(~ park_name)
```

## Exporting a ggplot graph with `ggsave()`

If we want our graph to appear in a knitted html, then we don't need to do anything else. But often we'll need a saved image file, of specific size and resolution, to share or for publication. 

`ggsave()` will export the *most recently run* ggplot graph by default (`plot = last_plot()`), unless you give it the name of a different saved ggplot object. Some common arguments for `ggsave()`:

- `width = `: set exported image width (default inches)
- `height = `: set exported image height (default height)
- `dpi = `: set dpi (dots per inch)

So to export the faceted graph above at 180 dpi, width a width of 8" and a height of 7", we can use:
```{r, include = FALSE}
ggsave(here("img","np_graph.jpg"), dpi = 180, width = 8, height = 7)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave(here("figures", "np_graph.jpg"), dpi = 180, width = 8, height = 7)
```

Notice that a .jpg image of that name and size is now stored in the `figures\` folder within your working directory. You can change the type of exported image, too (e.g. pdf, tiff, eps, png, mmp, svg).
