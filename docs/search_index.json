["overview.html", "Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Welcome! 2.2 Why learn R if I know Excel? 2.3 Guiding principles / recurring themes 2.4 Resources", " Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Welcome! In this workshop you will learn hands-on how to begin to interoperate between Excel and R. But this workshop is not only about learning R; we will learn R using additional software: RStudio and GitHub. These tools will help us develop good habits for working in a reproducible and collaborative way — critical attributes of the modern analyst. It’s going to be fun and empowering! 2.2 Why learn R if I know Excel? Excel is a widely used and powerful tool for working with data, and it is great for a lot of things. This is convenient and familiar; most of us have had their first experiences with data through Excel or other spreadsheet programs. As Jenny Bryan has said, “Excel is how we learn that we love data analysis”. Excel is great for data entry. Can also be good for looking at data and feeling like you can touch it, and creating quick exploratory figures. Excel can also become problematic with extending to analyses. This is because there aren’t firm lines between what is data and what is analyses. For example, in this sheet: This makes the analytical steps taken are not readily apparent, nor easy to reproduce. Have you ever done forensics on an Excel sheet, trying to understand what happened between columns or sheets? Maybe it was even your own Excel file from the (recent) past. This also makes them pretty brittle/sensitive to minor changes. Has seeing this ever given you a feeling of horror: So while it is great how easily you can update different fields and add analytical steps in an Excel sheet, it can also be a bit hard to handle, particularly as projects get more complicated. So, as automation, reproducibility, collaboration, and frequent reporting become increasingly expected in data analysis, a good option for Excel users is to extend their workflows with R. 2.2.1 What to expect This is going to be a fun workshop. This workshop will give you hands-on experience and confidence with R, and how to interoperate between Excel and R — it is not about wholesale replacing everything you do in Excel into R. We will learn technical skills that you can incrementally incorporate into your existing workflows. But a big part of interfacing between Excel and R is not only skillsets, it is mindsets. It is the mindset about how we think about data. How we shape data and organize data and analyze data. And how what we do now can make our analytical life better in the future. A modern R user has a workflow framed around collaboration, and uses an ecosystem of tools and practices. We will be learning three main things all at the same time: coding with best practices (R/RStudio/tidyverse) collaborative bookkeeping (Git/GitHub) reporting and publishing (RMarkdown/GitHub) R users keep raw data separate from their analyses, which means having data in one file and written computational commands saved as a separate file. We also embrace the concept of “tidy data”, where the data has a rectangular shape and each column is a variable and each row is an observation. Tidy data is a way of life. We are going to go through a lot in these two days and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll have experience with it and confidence that you can do it. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to work between R and Excel; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. You are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. Everyone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. Instructors and helpers learn something new every time, from each other and from your questions. If you are already familiar with some of this material, focus on how we teach, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this training is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole. 2.3 Guiding principles / recurring themes “Keep the raw data raw” — A hard line separating raw data and analyses. In R, we have data in one file and written computational commands saved as a separate file. Scripted analyses — We write analytical logic in code (rather than clicks) so that can be understood, rerun, and built upon. Learn from data that are not your own — We aren’t using your data in this workshop, but you will see similiarities and patterns, and you’ll see that these tools and practices apply to your work. Think ahead for Future You, Future Us. Help make lives easier — first and foremost your own. Create breadcrumbs for yourselves and others: document and share your work. 2.4 Resources R is not only a language, it is an active community of developers, users, and educators (often these traits are in each person). This workshop and book based on many excellent materials created by other members in the R community, who share their work freely to help others learn. Using community materials is how WE learned R, and each chapter of the book will have Resources listed for further reading into the topics we discuss. And, when there is no better way to explain something (ahem Jenny Bryan), we will quote or reference that work directly.

We are actually learning two languages at once: R and Markdown. 3.1.1 Objectives In this lesson we will: get oriented to the RStudio interface work with R in the console be introduced to built-in R functions learn to use the help pages explore RMarkdown 3.1.2 Resources R for Excel Users by Gordon Shotwell (blog) 3.2 Why learn R with RStudio You are all here today to learn how to code. Coding made me a better scientist because I was able to think more clearly about analyses, and become more efficient in doing so. Data scientists are creating tools that make coding more intuitive for new coders like us, and there is a wealth of awesome instruction and resources available to learn more and get help. Here is an analogy to start us off. Think of yourself as a pilot, and R is your airplane. You can use R to go places! With practice you’ll gain skills and confidence; you can fly further distances and get through tricky situations. You will become an awesome pilot and can fly your plane anywhere. And if R were an airplane, RStudio is the airport. RStudio provides support! Runways, communication, community, and other services that makes your life as a pilot much easier. So it’s not only the infrastructure (the user interface or IDE), although it is a great way to learn and interact with your variables, files, and interact directly with GitHub. It’s also a data science philosophy, R packages, community, and more. So although you can fly your plane without an airport and we could learn R without RStudio, that’s not what we’re going to do. We are learning R together with RStudio and its many supporting features. 3.3 RStudio Orientation Open RStudio for the first time. Launch RStudio/R. Notice the default panes: Console (entire left) Environment/History (tabbed in upper right) Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right) FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: Customizing RStudio. An important first question: where are we? If you’ve have opened RStudio for the first time, you’ll be in your Home directory. This is noted by the ~/ at the top of the console. You can see too that the Files pane in the lower right shows what is in the Home directory where you are. You can navigate around within that Files pane and explore, but note that you won’t change where you are: even as you click through you’ll still be Home: ~/. 3.3.1 R Console OK let’s go into the Console, where we interact with the live R process. We can do math: 52*40 365/12 But like Excel, the power comes not from doing small operations by hand (like 8*22.3), it’s by being able to operate on whole suites of numbers and datasets. In Excel, data are stored in the spreadsheet. In R, they are stored in objects, which are often vectors or dataframes. They are rectangular. 3.3.2 Viewing data in R Let’s have a look at some data in R. Unlike Excel, R comes out-of-the-box with several built-in data sets that we can look at and work with. One of these datasets is called cars. If I write this in the Console, it will print the data in the console. cars This returns data. To me this is not super interesting data, but I can appreciate that there are different variables listed as column headers and then numeric values for each type of row observation. (Unfortunately I don’t know if these are different cars or trials or conditions but we won’t focus on that for now). I can also use RStudio’s Viewer to see this in a more familiar-looking format. Let’s type this — and make sure it’s a capital V and open and closed parentheses: View(cars) This opens the fourth pane of the RStudio IDE; when you work in R you will have all four panes open so this will become a very comforting setup for you. Aside The basic R data structure is a vector. You can think of a vector like a column in an Excel spreadsheet with the limitation that all the data in that vector must be of the same type. If it is a character vector, every element must be a character; if it is a logical vector, every element must be TRUE or FALSE; if it’s numeric you can trust that every element is a number. There’s no such constraint in Excel: you might have a column which has a bunch of numbers, but then some explanatory test intermingled with the numbers. This isn’t allowed in R. - Gordon Shotwell In the Viewer I can do things like filter or sort. This does not do anything to the actual data, it just changes how you are viewing the data. So even as I explore it, I am not editing or manipulating the data. 3.3.3 R functions, help pages Like Excel, some of the biggest power in R is that there are built-in functions that you can use in your analyses (and, as we’ll see, R users can easily create and share functions, and it is this open source developer and contributor community that makes R so awesome). R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are used with the same syntax: function name with parentheses around what the function needs to do what it is supposed to do. function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...). When you see this syntax, we say we are “calling the function”. Let’s try using seq() which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, demo more helpful features of RStudio. Type se and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify seq() by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function’s arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane. Type the arguments 1, 10 and hit return. seq(1, 10) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 We could probably infer that the seq() function makes a sequence, but let’s learn for sure. Type (and you can autocomplete) and let’s explore the help page: ?seq help(seq) # same as ?seq When I press enter/return, it will open up a help page in the bottom right pane. Help pages vary in detail I find some easier to digest than others. But they all have the same structure, which is helpful to know. The help page tells the name of the package in the top left, and broken down into sections: Description: An extended description of what the function does. Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values. Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting. Details: Any important details to be aware of. Value: The data the function returns. See Also: Any related functions you might find useful. Examples: Some examples for how to use the function. When I look at a help page, I start with the description, which might be too in-the-weeds for the level of understanding I need at the offset. For the sum page, it is pretty straight-forward and lets me know that yup, this is the function I want. I next look at the usage and arguments, which give me a more concrete view into what the function does. This syntax looks a bit cryptic but what it means is that you use it by writing sum, and then passing whatever you want to it in terms of data: that is what the “…” means. And the “na.rm=FALSE” means that by default, it will not remove NAs (I read this as: “remove NAs? FALSE!”) Then, I usually scroll down to the bottom to the examples. This is where I can actually see how the function is used, and I can also paste those examples into the Console to see their output. Let’s try it: seq(from = 1, to = 10) # same as seq(1, 10); R assumes by position ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 The above also demonstrates something about how R resolves function arguments. You can always specify in name = value form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want a sequence from = 1 that goes to = 10. Since we didn’t specify step size, the default value of by in the function definition is used, which ends up being 1 in this case. For functions I call often, I might use this resolve by position for the first argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use name = value. The examples from the help pages can be copy-pasted into the console for you to understand what’s going on. Remember we were talking about expecting there to be a function for something you want to do? Let’s try it. 3.3.4 Activity Exercise: Talk to your neighbor(s) and look up the help file for a function that you know or expect to exist. Here are some ideas: ?getwd(), ?plot(), min(), max(), ?mean(), ?log()). Let’s try another. In Excel, there is a “SUM” function to calculate a total. Let’s expect that there is the same in R. I will type this into the Console: sum(1, 2, 3) R is case-sensitive. So “sum” is a completely different thing to “Sum” or “SUM”. And this is true for the names of functions, data sets, variable names, and data itself (“blue” vs “Blue”). Awesome. Let’s try this on our cars data sum(cars) Alright. What is this number? It is the sum of ALL of the data in the cars dataset. Maybe in some analysis this would be a useful operation, but I would worry about the way your data is set up and your analyses if this is ever something you’d want to do. More likely, you’d want to take the sum of a specific column. In R, you can do that with the $ operator. Let’s say we want to calculate the total distance: sum(cars$dist) There are many functions that are built into R, and we’ll learn more of them shortly. Not all functions have (or require) arguments: date() ## [1] &quot;Thu Dec 19 06:21:40 2019&quot; 3.3.5 Packages So far we’ve been using a couple functions from base R, such as sum() and date(). But, one of the amazing things about R is that a vast user community is always creating new functions and packages that expand R’s capabilities. In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. The traditional place to download packages is from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, which is where you downloaded R. You can also install packages from GitHub, which we’ll do tomorrow. You don’t need to go to CRAN’s website to install packages, this can be accomplished within R using the command install.packages(&quot;package-name-in-quotes&quot;). Let’s install a small, fun package praise. You need to use quotes around the package name. Do this in the Console instead of in your RMarkdown file because we don’t want this to load every time: install.packages(&quot;praise&quot;) Now we’ve installed the package, but we need to tell R that we are going to use the functions within the praise package. We do this by using the function library(). In my mind, this is analogous to needing to wire your house for electricity: this is something you do once; this is install.packages. But then you need to turn on the lights each time you need them (R Session). library(praise) Now that we’ve loaded the praise package, we can use the single function in the package, praise(), which returns a randomized praise to make you feel better. praise() ## [1] &quot;You are ultimate!&quot; 3.3.6 Assigning objects with &lt;- This might be a really important value that we want to have on hand. We can save this as its own object. This is a big difference with Excel, where you usually identify data by its location on the grid, like $A1:D$20. (You can do this with Excel by naming ranges of cells, but many people don’t do this.) Data can be a variety of formats, like numeric and text. We do this by writing the name along with the assignment operator &lt;- sum_dist &lt;- sum(cars$dist) And we can execute it. In my head I hear “sum_dist gets 2149”. Object names can be whatever you want, although they cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. Different folks have different conventions; you will be wise to adopt a convention for demarcating words in names. # i_use_snake_case # other.people.use.periods # evenOthersUseCamelCase Notice that as I start typing sum_dist in the Console, there will be options to auto-fill. This is RStudio helping you out, which is great because we all are prone to typos. I actually have to ignore the help to try to force a typo: sumdist # Error: object &#39;sumdist&#39; not found OK this is an error, but I didn’t break R — error messages are your friends. The first thing to do with an error message is read it. Yes it’s in angry red text and it’s unexpected — but most error messages are doing their best to help you solve the problem. And you’ll get more familiar with they way they tell you. By saying “object ‘sumdist’ not found” alerts me immediately to the fact that this thing I think exists R doesn’t think exists — so maybe it’s a typo or not loaded? 3.3.7 Error messages are your friends As Jenny Bryan says: Implicit contract with the computer / scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Pay attention to how you type. Remember that this is a language, not unsimilar to English! There are times you aren’t understood – it’s going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you’ll get an error. This is like someone saying ‘What?’ or ‘Pardon’? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say ‘I didn’t understand what you said, I was expecting you to say blah’. That is a great type of error message. Error messages are your friend. Google them (copy-and-paste!) to figure out what they mean. And also know that there are errors that can creep in more subtly, when you are giving information that is understood, but not in the way you meant. Like if I am telling a story about suspenders that my British friend hears but silently interprets in a very different way (true story). This can leave me thinking I’ve gotten something across that the listener (or R) might silently interpreted very differently. And as I continue telling my story you get more and more confused… Clear communication is critical when you code: write clean, well documented code and check your work as you go to minimize these circumstances! 3.3.8 Logical operators and expressions A moment about logical operators and expressions. We can ask questions about the objects we made. This is not assigning a new value to our sum_dist object. == means ‘is equal to’ != means ‘is not equal to’ &lt; means ` is less than’ &gt; means ` is greater than’ &lt;= means ` is less than or equal to’ &gt;= means ` is greater than or equal to’ sum_dist == 2 ## [1] FALSE sum_dist &lt;= 3000 ## [1] TRUE sum_dist != 500 ## [1] TRUE Shortcuts You will make lots of assignments and the operator &lt;- is a pain to type. Don’t be lazy and use =, although it would work, because it will just sow confusion later. Instead, utilize RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds &lt;- with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces. RStudio offers many handy keyboard shortcuts. Also, Alt+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card. My most common shortcuts include command-Z (undo), and combinations of arrow keys in combination with shift/option/command (moving quickly up, down, sideways, with or without highlighting. 3.4 Clearing the environment Now look at the objects in your environment (workspace) – in the upper right pane. The workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. For reproducibility, it is critical that you delete your objects and restart your R session frequently. You don’t want your whole analysis to only work in whatever way you’ve been working right now — you need it to work next week, after you upgrade your operating system, etc. Restarting your R session will help you identify and account for anything you need for your analysis. We will keep coming back to this theme but let’s restart our R session together: Go to the top menus: Session &gt; Restart R. Don’t save the workspace! So this is great, but if we were going to do any kind of real analysis, we need to be able to write it in a document rather than this command line prompt in the Console. Let’s do something much more interesting and really start feeling its power. 3.5 Intro to RMarkdown An RMarkdown file is a special type of file for making reports — it allow us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots. This is really critical to reproducibility, and it also saves time. This document will recreate your figures for you in the same document where you are writing text. So no more doing analysis, saving a plot, pasting that plot into Word, redoing the analysis, re-saving, re-pasting, etc. Let’s experience this a bit ourselves and then we’ll talk about it more. 3.5.1 Create an RMarkdown file File -&gt; New File -&gt; RMarkdown… -&gt; Document of output format HTML, OK. You can give it a Title like “Testing” (a name that’s totally ok to use as you’re trying something out). Then click OK. OK, first off: by opening a file, we are seeing the 4th pane of the RStudio console, which is essentially a text editor. This lets us organize our files within RStudio instead of having a bunch of different windows open. Let’s have a look at this file — it’s not blank; there is some initial text is already provided for you. Notice a few things about it: Title and Author are auto-filled, and the today’s date has been added There are white and grey sections. These are the 2 main languages that make up an RMarkdown file. Grey sections are R code White sections are Markdown text 3.5.2 Knit your RMarkdown file Let’s go ahead and “Knit” by clicking the blue yarn at the top of the RMarkdown file. It’s going to ask us to save first, I’ll name mine “testing.Rmd”. How cool is this, we’ve just made an html file, a webpage that we are viewing locally on our own computers. Knitting this RMarkdown document has rendered — we also say formatted — both the Markdown text (white) and the R code (grey), and the it also executed — we also say ran — the R code. Let’s have a look at them side-by-side: Let’s take a deeper look at these two files. So much of learning to code is looking for patterns. 3.5.3 R code chunks Notice how the grey R code chunks are surrounded by 3 backticks and {r LABEL}. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of summary(cars) and the output plot in the case of plot(pressure). Notice how the code plot(pressure) is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option echo=FALSE. We can create a new chunk in your RMarkdown first in one of these ways: click “Insert &gt; R” at the top of the editor pane type by hand ```{r} ``` if you haven’t deleted a chunk that came with the new file, edit that one Now, let’s write some code in R. Earlier we calculated sum(cars$dist). Now let’s do the average. In R, this is the mean() function mean_dist &lt;- mean(cars$dist) Now, hitting return does not execute this command; remember, it’s a text file in the text editor, it’s not associated with the R engine. To execute it, we need to get what we typed in the the R chunk (the grey R code) down into the console. How do we do it? There are several ways (let’s do each of them): copy-paste this line into the console. select the line (or simply put the cursor there), and click ‘Run’. This is available from the bar above the file (green arrow) the menu bar: Code &gt; Run Selected Line(s) keyboard shortcut: command-return click the green arrow at the right of the code chunk And when we do this, we see the mean_dist object appear in he Environment pane. Cool tip: doesn’t have to be only R, other languages supported. 3.5.4 Activity (3 min) Calculate the maximum cars distance in your RMarkdown file by typing max(cars$dist). Remember to write your R code within a code chunk (grey)! Execute your commands by trying the three ways above. Then, knit your R Markdown file, which will also save the Rmd by default. 3.5.5 Markdown sections The second language is Markdown. This is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only about 15 rules to know. Notice the syntax for: headers get rendered at multiple levels: #, ## bold: **word** There are some good cheatsheets to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help &gt; Markdown Quick Reference Learn more: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ 3.5.6 Activity In Markdown write some italic text, make a numbered list, and add a few subheaders. Use the Markdown Quick Reference (in the menu bar: Help &gt; Markdown Quick Reference). Reknit your html file. 3.5.7 Restart R To end our work from this session, save, knit, and then restart R (Go to the top menus: Session &gt; Restart R.) Notice that now with a clean workspace, if I knit my document instead of sending code to the Console, my objects (like mean_dist) don’t show up in my Environment. This is because R isn’t actually running this in this R session, it is actually spinning up a clean session to knit my document. This is important for reproducible analyses because I don’t want the success of this analysis to be dependent on some weird setting I have on my computer that will make Future Me or Future Us not able to run or understand these important analyses. Having RMarkdown be self-contained in this way helps you develop good habits for reproducibility. 3.5.8 What is RMarkdown? (1-minute video) Let’s watch this to demonstrate all the amazing things you can now do: What is RMarkdown? 3.6 Deep thoughts Comments! Organization (spacing, subsections, vertical structure, indentation, etc.)! Well-named variables! Also, well-named operations so analyses (select(data, columnname)) instead of data[1:6,5] and excel equivalent. (Ex with strings) Not so brittle/sensitive to minor changes. 3.7 Efficiency Tips "],

Why use version control? To save time when working with your most important collaborator: you. 4.2 Objectives Today, we’ll interface with GitHub from our local computers using RStudio. There are many other ways to interact with GitHub, including GitHub’s Desktop App or the command line (here is Jenny Bryan’s list of git clients), but today we are going to work from RStudio. You have the largest suite of options if you interface through the command line, but the most common things you’ll do can be done through one of these other applications (i.e. RStudio and the GitHub Desktop App). Here’s what we’ll do after we set up git on your computers: create a repository on Github.com clone locally using RStudio learn the RStudio-GitHub workflow by syncing to Github.com: pull, stage, commit, push explore github.com: files, commit history, file history practice the RStudio-GitHub workflow by editing and adding files practice R Markdown git will track and version your files, GitHub stores this online and enables you to collaborate with others (and yourself). Although git and GitHub are two different things, distinct from each other, we can think of them as a bundle since we will always use them together. It also helped me to think of GitHub like Dropbox: you make folders that are ‘tracked’ and can be synced to the cloud. GitHub does this too, but you have to be more deliberate about when syncs are made. This is because GitHub saves these as different versions, with information about who contributed when, line-by-line. This makes collaboration easier, and it allows you to roll-back to different versions or contribute to others’ work. 4.3 Resources These materials borrow from: Jenny Bryan’s lectures from STAT545 at UBC: The Shell Jenny Bryan’s Happy git with R tutorial Melanie Frazier’s GitHub Quickstart, GitHub Lesson at University of Queensland Ben Best’s Software Carpentry at UCSB Today, we’ll only introduce the features and terminology that new R users need to learn to begin managing their projects. 4.4 Why should R users use Github? Ends (or, nearly ends) the horror of keeping track of versions. Basically, we get away from this: When you open your repository, you only see the most recent version. But, it easy to compare versions, and you can easily revert to previous versions. Improves collaborative efforts. Different researchers can work on the same files at the same time! It is easy to share and distribute files through the Github website. Your files are available anywhere, you just need internet connection! 4.4.1 What are Git and Github? Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time. These files can be any kind of file (eg .doc, .pdf, .xls), but free text differences are most easily visible (eg txt, csv, md). Github is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely. It has many nice features to be able visualize differences between images, rendering &amp; diffing map data files, render text data files, and track changes in text. Github was developed for social coding (i.e., sort of like an open source Wikipedia for programmers). Consequently, much of the functionality and terminology of Github (e.g., branches and pull requests) isn’t necessary for a new R user getting started. These concepts are more important for coders who want the entire coding community (and not just people working on the same project) to be able to suggest changes to their code. This isn’t how most new R users will use Github. To get the full functionality of Github, you will eventually want to learn other concepts. But, this can wait. 4.4.2 Some Github terminology User: A Github account for you (e.g., jules32). Organization: The Github account for one or more user (e.g., datacarpentry). Repository: A folder within the organization that includes files dedicated to a project. Local Github: Copies of Github files located your computer. Remote Github: Github files located on the https://github.com website. Clone: Process of making a local copy of a remote Github repository. This only needs to be done once (unless you mess up your local copy). Pull: Copy changes on the remote Github repository to your local Github repository. This is useful if multiple people are making changes to a repository. Push: Save local changes to remote Github 4.5 Setup Git &amp; GitHub We’re going to switch gears from R for a moment and set up Git and GitHub, which we will be using along with R and RStudio for the rest of the workshop. This set up is a one-time thing! You will only have to do this once per computer. We’ll walk through this together. We will use the usethis package to configure git with global commands, which means it will apply ‘globally’ to all files on your computer, rather than to a specific folder. install.packages(&quot;usethis&quot;) library(usethis) use_git_config(user.name = &quot;jules32&quot;, user.email = &quot;jules32@example.org&quot;) BACKUP PLAN If usethis fails, the following is the classic approach to configuring git. Open the Git Bash program (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) and type the following: # display your version of git git --version # replace USER with your Github user account git config --global user.name USER # replace NAME@EMAIL.EDU with the email you used to register with Github git config --global user.email NAME@EMAIL.EDU # list your config to confirm user.* variables set git config --list Not only have you just set up git as a one-time-only thing, you have just used the command line. We don’t have time to learn much of the command line today, but you just successfully used it following explicit instructions, which is huge! There are great resources for learning the command line, check out this tutorial from SWC at UCSB. 4.5.1 Troubleshooting If you have problems setting up git, please see the Troubleshooting section in Jenny Bryan’s amazing HappyGitWithR. 4.5.1.1 New(ish) Error on a Mac We’ve also seen the following errors from RStudio: error key does not contain a section --global terminal and fatal: not in a git directory To solve this, go to the Terminal and type: which git Look at the filepath that is returned. Does it say anything to do with Apple? -&gt; If yes, then the Git you downloaded isn’t installed, please redownload if necessary, and follow instructions to install. -&gt; If no, (in the example image, the filepath does not say anything with Apple) then proceed below: In RStudio, navigate to: Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN. Does the “Git executable” filepath match what the url in Terminal says? If not, click the browse button and navigate there. Note: on my laptop, even though I navigated to /usr/local/bin/git, it then automatically redirect because /usr/local/bin/git was an alias on my computer. That is fine. Click OK. Quit RStudio. Then relaunch RStudio. Try syncing or cloning, and if that works and then you don’t need to worry about typing into the Terminal, you’re all done! 4.6 Create a repository on Github.com First, go to your account on github.com and click “New repository”. Choose a name. Call it whatever you want (the shorter the better), or follow me for convenience. I will call mine r-workshop. Also, add a description, make it public, create a README file, and create your repo! The Add gitignore option adds a document where you can identify files or file-types you want Github to ignore. These files will stay in on the local Github folder (the one on your computer), but will not be uploaded onto the web version of Github. The Add a license option adds a license that describes how other people can use your Github files (e.g., open source, but no one can profit from them, etc.). We won’t worry about this today. Check out our new repository! Notice how the README.md file we created is automatically displayed at the bottom. The .md means that it is Markdown (remember how .Rmd was RMarkdown?) so the formatting we learned in the last lesson apply here. 4.7 Create a gh-pages branch We aren’t going to talk about branches very much, but they are a powerful feature of git/GitHub. I think of it as creating a copy of your work that becomes a parallel universe that you can modify safely because it’s not affecting your original work. And then you can choose to merge the universes back together if and when you want. By default, when you create a new repo you begin with one branch, and it is named master. When you create new branches, you can name them whatever you want. However, if you name one gh-pages (all lowercase, with a - and no spaces), this will let you create a website. And that’s our plan. So, let’s do this to create a gh-pages branch: On the homepage for your repo on GitHub.com, click the button that says “Branch:master”. Here, you can switch to another branch (right now there aren’t any others besides master), or create one by typing a new name. Let’s type gh-pages. Let’s also change gh-pages to the default branch and delete the master branch: this will be a one-time-only thing that we do here: First click to control branches: And then click to change the default branch to gh-pages. I like to then delete the master branch when it has the little red trash can next to it. It will make you confirm that you really want to delete it, which I do! From here, you will work locally (on your computer). 4.8 Clone your repository using RStudio We’ll start of by cloning to our local computer using RStudio. We are going to be cloning a copy of our Remote repository on Github.com to our local computers. Unlike downloading, cloning keeps all the version control and user information bundled with the files. Step 0: Create your github folder This is really important! We need to be organized and deliberate about where we want to keep all of our GitHub repositories (since this is the first of many in your career). Let’s all make a folder called github (all lowercase!) in our home directories. So it will look like this: Windows: Users\\[User]\\Documents\\github\\ Mac: Users/[User]/github/ This will let us take advantage of something that is really key about GitHub.com: you can easily navigate through folders within repositories and the urls reflect this navigation. The greatness of this will be evident soon. So let’s set ourselves up for easily translating (and remembering) those navigation paths by having a folder called github that will serve as our ‘github.com’. So really. Make sure that you have an all-lowercase folder called github in your home directory!! Step 1: Copy the web address of the repository you want to clone. Step 2: from RStudio, go to New Project (also in the File menu). Step 3: Select Version Control Step 4: Select Git Step 5: Paste it in the Repository URL field, and type tab to autofill the Project Directory name. Make sure you keep the Project Directory Name THE SAME as the repository name from the URL. Save it in your github folder (click on Browse) to do this. If everything went well, the repository will be added to the list located here: And the repository will be saved to the Github folder on your computer: Ta da!!!! The folder doesn’t contain much of interest, but we are going to change that. 4.9 Inspect your repository Notice a few things in our repo here: Our working directory is set to ~/github/r-workshop. This means that I can start working with the files I have in here without setting the filepath. This is that when we cloned this from RStudio, it created an RStudio project, which you can tell because: .RProj file, which you can see in the Files pane. The project is named in the top right hand corner We have a git tab! This is how we will interface directly to Github.com When you first clone a repo through RStudio, RStudio will add an .Rproj file to your repo. And if you didn’t add a .gitignore file when you originally created the repo on GitHub.com, RStudio will also add this for you. These will show up with little yellow ? icons in your git tab. This is GitHub’s way of saying: “I am responsible for tracking everything that happens in this repo, but I haven’t seen these files yet. Do you want me to track them too?” (We’ll see that when you click the box to stage them, they will turn into As because they have been added to the repo. 4.10 Add files to our local repo The repository will contain: .gitignore file README.md Rproj Let’s create the following: folder called “data” folder called “figures” They both show up in your Finder! … 4.10.1 Get data files into your working directory In Session 1, we introduced how and why R Projects are great for reproducibility, because our self-contained working directory will be the first place R looks for files. You downloaded several files for this workshop, some comma separate value (CSV) files and some as Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx): fish_counts_curated.csv invert_counts_curated.xlsx kelp_counts_curated.xlsx substrate_cover_curated.xlsx lobsters.xlsx lobsters2.xlsx ca_np.csv ci_np.xlsx Copy and paste those files into the ‘data’ subfolder of your R project. Notice that now these files are in your working directory when you go back to that Project in RStudio (check the ‘Files’ tab and navigate to the data subfolder). That means they’re going to be in the first place R will look when you ask it to find a file to read in. I’m going to go to the Finder (Windows Explorer on a PC) and copy a file into my repository from there. And then I’m going to go back to RStudio – it shows up in the git tab! So the repository is being tracked, no matter how you make changes to it (changes do not have to be done only through RStudio). To make changes to the repository, you will work from your computer (“local Github”). When files are changed in the local repository, these changes will be reflected in the Git tab of RStudio: 4.10.2 Inspect what has changed These are the codes RStudio uses to describe how the files are changed, (from the RStudio cheatsheet): 4.11 Sync from RStudio to GitHub When you are ready to commit your changes, you follow these steps: We walk through this process below: 4.11.1 Pull From the Git tab, “Pull” the repository. This makes sure your local repository is synced with the remote repository. This is very important if other people are making changes to the repository or if you are working from multiple computers. 4.11.2 Stage Stage the files you want to commit. In RStudio, this involves checking the “Staged” boxes: 4.11.3 Commit 4.11.4 Push 4.12 Explore remote Github The files you added should be on github.com: Let’s also explore commit history, file history. 4.12.1 Activity Go back to RStudio. This time let’s edit an existing file instead of adding something new. Open your README file by clicking on it in the Files pane (lower right corner). Write a few lines of text (like your dog’s name), save, and see what happens in your Git Tab. Sync it to your remote repository at Github.com. 4.13 Create a new R Markdown file Now get ourselves back into learning R. We are going to use R Markdown so that you can write notes to yourself in Markdown, and have a record of all your R code. Writing R commands in the console like we did this morning is great, but limited; it’s hard to keep track of and hard to efficiently share with others. Plus, as your analyses get more complicated, you need to be able to see them all in one place. Go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown … (or click the green plus in the top left corner). Let’s set up this file so we can use it for the rest of the day. I’m going to delete all the text that is already there and write some new text. Here’s what I’m going to write in my R Markdown file to begin: --- title: &quot;Reading data into R with `readxl`&quot; author: &quot;Julie Lowndes&quot; date: &quot;12/7/2019&quot; output: html_document --- # Learning `readxl` We are working with data and it&#39;s going to be amazing. Now, let’s save it. I’m going to call my file readxl.Rmd. You can knit it if you’d like. Then, knit your file, and sync your file to GitHub: commit and pull What if a file doesn’t show up in the Git tab and you expect that it should? Check to make sure you’ve saved the file. If the filename is red with an asterix, there have been changes since it was saved. Remember to save before syncing to GitHub! 4.14 Explore your webpage You’ve just created a webpage! It will exist at this url: username.github.io/repo-name/filename. Mine is: jules32.github.io/r-workshop/readxl. ProTip Pay attention to URLs. An unsung skill of the modern analyst is to be able to navigate the internet by keeping an eye on patterns. Troubleshooting: 404 error? Remove trailing / from the url Wants you to download? Remove trailing .Rmd from the url 4.15 Committing - how often? Tracking changes in your files Whenever you make changes to the files in Github, you will walk through the Pull -&gt; Stage -&gt; Commit -&gt; Push steps. I tend to do this every time I finish a task (basically when I start getting nervous that I will lose my work). Once something is committed, it is very difficult to lose it. One thing that I love about about Github is that it is easy to see how files have changed over time. Usually I compare commits through github.com: You can click on the commits to see how the files changed from the previous commit: 4.16 Happy Git with R If you have problems, we’ll help you out using Jenny Bryan’s HappyGitWithR, particularly the sections on Detect Git from RStudio and RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell (troubleshooting). So as we are coming around, have a look at it and see if you can help troubleshoot too! 4.17 Efficiency Tips "],
["readxl.html", "Chapter 5 readxl 5.1 Summary 5.2 Lesson 5.3 Activity: Import some invertebrates! 5.4 Efficiency Tips 5.5 Additional thoughts", " Chapter 5 readxl 5.1 Summary Check this, may need to be a block quote: The readxl package makes it easy to import tabular data from Excel spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx files) and includes several options for cleaning data during import. readxl has no external dependencies and functions on any operating system, making it an OS- and user-friendly package that simplifies getting your data from Excel into R. 5.1.1 Objectives Use read_csv() to read in a comma separated value (CSV) file Use read_excel() to read in an Excel worksheet from an Excel workbook Replace a specific string/value in a spreadsheet with with NA Skip n rows when importing an Excel worksheet Use read_excel() to read in parts of a worksheet (by cell range) Specify column names when importing Excel data Read and combine data from multiple Excel worksheets into a single df using purrr::map_df() Write data using write_csv() or write_xlsx() 5.1.2 Resources https://readxl.tidyverse.org/ readxl Workflows article (from tidyverse.org) 5.2 Lesson 5.2.1 Attach packages In the .Rmd you just created within your version-controlled r-workshop R project, attach the tidyverse, readxl, writexl, and here packages. In this lesson, we’ll read in a CSV file with the read_csv() function, so we need to have the readr package attached. Since it’s part of the tidyverse, we’ll go ahead and attach the tidyverse package below our script header using library(package_name). It’s a good idea to attach packages within the set-up chunk in R Markdown, so we’ll also attach the readxl, writexl, and here packages there. Here’s our first code chunk: {r setup, eval = FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # Attach the tidyverse, readxl, writexl and here packages: library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(writexl) library(here) Now, all of the packages and functions within the tidyverse and readxl, including read_csv() and read_excel(), are available for use. 5.2.2 Use read_csv() to read in data from a CSV file There are many types of files containing data that you might want to work with in R. A common one is a comma separated value (CSV) file, which contains values with each column entry separated by a comma delimiter. CSVs can be opened, viewed, and worked with in Excel just like an .xls or .xlsx file - but let’s learn how to get data directly from a CSV into R where we can work with it more reproducibly. The CSV we’ll read in here is called “fish_counts_curated.csv”, and contains observations for “the abundance and size of fish species as part of SBCLTER’s kelp forest monitoring program to track long-term patterns in species abundance and diversity” from the Santa Barbara Channel Long Term Ecological Research program. Source: Reed D. 2018. SBC LTER: Reef: Kelp Forest Community Dynamics: Fish abundance. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/dbd1d5f0b225d903371ce89b09ee7379. Dataset accessed 9/26/2019. Read in the “fish_counts_curated.csv” file read_csv(&quot;file_name.csv&quot;), and store it in R as an object called fish_counts: fish_counts &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;fish_counts_curated.csv&quot;)) Notice that the name of the stored object (here, fish_counts) will show up in our Environment tab in RStudio. Click on the object in the Environment, and R will automatically run the View() function for you to pull up your data in a separate viewing tab. Now we can look at it in the spreadsheet format we’re used to. Here are a few other functions for quickly exploring imported data: summary(): summary of class, dimensions, NA values, etc. names(): variable names (column headers) ls(): list all objects in environment head(): Show the first x rows (default is 6 lines) tail(): Show the last x rows (default is 6 lines) Now that we have our fish counts data ready to work with in R, let’s get the substrate cover and kelp data (both .xlsx files). In the following sections, we’ll learn that we can use read_excel() to read in Excel files directly. 5.2.3 Use read_excel() to read in a single Excel worksheet First, take a look at substrate_cover_curated.xlsx in Excel, which contains a single worksheet with substrate type and percent cover observations at different sampling locations in the Santa Barbara Channel. A few things to notice: The file contains a single worksheet There are multiple rows containing text information up top Where observations were not recorded, there exists ‘-9999’ Let’s go ahead and read in the data. If the file is in our working directory, we can read in a single worksheet .xlsx file using read_excel(&quot;file_name.xlsx&quot;). Note: read_excel() works for both .xlsx and .xls types. Like this: substrate_cover &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;substrate_cover_curated.xlsx&quot;)) Tada? Not quite. Click on the object name (substrate_cover) in the Environment to view the data in a new tab. A few things aren’t ideal: substrate_cover ## # A tibble: 23,942 x 9 ## `Substrate cover dataset,… ...2 ...3 ...4 ...5 ...6 ...7 ...8 ...9 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Source: https://portal.ed… &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 Accessed: 9/28/2019 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 year month date site tran… quad side subst… perce… ## 5 -9999 -9999 -9999 carp 1 20 i b -9999 ## 6 2000 9 -9999 carp 1 20 o b -9999 ## 7 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 20 i b 100 ## 8 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 20 o b 100 ## 9 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 40 i b 100 ## 10 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 40 o b 100 ## # … with 23,932 more rows The top row of text has automatically become the (messy) column headers There are multiple descriptive rows before we actually get to the data There are -9999s that we want R to understand as NA instead We can deal with those issues by adding arguments within read_excel(). Like: Add skip = n to skip the first ‘n’ rows when importing data Add na = &quot;this&quot; to replace “this” with NA when reading in spreadsheet data substrate_cover &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;substrate_cover_curated.xlsx, skip = 4, na = &quot;-9999&quot;) substrate_cover ## # A tibble: 23,938 x 9 ## year month date site transect quad side substrate_type percent_cover ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; carp 1 20 i b &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 2000 9 &lt;NA&gt; carp 1 20 o b &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 20 i b 100 ## 4 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 20 o b 100 ## 5 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 40 i b 100 ## 6 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 1 40 o b 100 ## 7 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 2 20 i b 90 ## 8 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 2 20 o b 80 ## 9 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 2 40 i b 80 ## 10 2000 9 9/8/00 carp 2 40 o b 85 ## # … with 23,928 more rows Check out substrate_cover, and see that the first row after the 4 skipped are the column names, and all -9999s have been updated to NA. Hooray! 5.2.4 Use read_excel() to read in only part of an Excel worksheet We always advocate for leaving the raw data raw, and writing a complete script containing all steps of data wrangling &amp; transformation. But in some situations (be careful), you may want to specify a range of cells to read in from an Excel worksheet. You can specify a range of cells to read in using the range = argument in read_excel(). For example, if I want to read in the rectangle from D12:I15 in substrate_cover_curated.xlsx - only observations for Carpenteria Beach (Transect 2) in September 2000 - I can use: carp_cover_2000 &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;substrate_cover_curated.xlsx&quot;, range = &quot;D12:I15&quot;) But yuck. Look at carp_cover_2000 and you’ll notice that the first row of that range is automatically made the column headers. To keep all rows within a range and add your own column names, add a col_names = argument: carp_cover_2000 &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;substrate_cover_curated.xlsx&quot;, range = &quot;D12:I15&quot;, col_names = c(&quot;site_name&quot;, &quot;transect&quot;, &quot;quad&quot;, &quot;plot_side&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;coverage&quot;)) carp_cover_2000 ## # A tibble: 4 x 6 ## site_name transect quad plot_side type coverage ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 carp 2 20 i b 90 ## 2 carp 2 20 o b 80 ## 3 carp 2 40 i b 80 ## 4 carp 2 40 o b 85 So far we’ve read in a single CSV file using read_csv(), and an Excel file containing a single worksheet with read_excel(). Next, let’s read in data from an Excel workbook that contains multiple worksheets. 5.2.5 Use read_excel() to read in selected worksheets from a workbook Now, we’ll read in the kelp fronds data from file kelp_counts_curated.xlsx. Open the file in Excel, and notice see that it contains multiple worksheets with giant kelp observations in the Santa Barbara Channel during July 2016, 2017, and 2018, with data collected at each site in a separate worksheet. To read in a single Excel worksheet from a workbook we’ll again use read_excel(&quot;file_name.xlsx&quot;), but we’ll need to let R know which worksheet to get. Let’s read in the kelp data just like we did above, as an object called kelp_counts. kelp_counts &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;) You might be thinking, “Hooray, I got all of my Excel workbook data!” But remember to always look at your data - you will see that actually only the first worksheet was read in. The default in read_excel() is to read in the first worksheet in a multi-sheet Excel workbook. To check the worksheet names in an Excel workbook, use excel_sheets(): excel_sheets(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;) If we want to read in data from a worksheet other than the first one in an Excel workbook, we can specify the correct worksheet by name or position by adding the sheet argument. Let’s read in data from the worksheet named golb (Goleta Beach) in the kelp_counts_curated.xlsx workbook: kelp_golb &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;golb&quot;)) Note that you can also specify a worksheet by position: since golb is the 6th worksheet in the workbook, we could also use the following: kelp_golb &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 6)) kelp_golb ## # A tibble: 3 x 4 ## year month site total_fronds ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2016 7 golb 2557 ## 2 2017 7 golb 1575 ## 3 2018 7 golb 1629 5.2.6 Read in and combine data from multiple worksheets into a data frame simultaneously with purrr::map_df() So far, we’ve read in entire Excel worksheets and pieces of a worksheet. What if we have a workbook (like kelp_counts_curated.xlsx) that contains worksheets that contain observations for the same variables, in the same organization? Then we may want to read in data from all worksheets, and combine them into a single data frame. We’ll use purrr::map_df() to loop through all the worksheets in a workbook, reading them in &amp; putting them together into a single data frame in the process. The steps we’ll go through in the code below are: Set a pathway so that R knows where to look for an Excel workbook Get the names of all worksheets in that workbook with excel_sheets() Set names of a vector with set_names() Read in all worksheets, and put them together into a single data frame with purrr::map_df() Aside: the pipe operator (%&gt;%) There are many ways to use R functions in sequence. One way, that follows the order that we think about steps in sequence, is using the pipe operator (%&gt;%). We can use the pipe operator between steps in a sequence, each place we think “and then do this.” For example, if I would like to walk my dog and then eat a burrito, in code that might be: walk(dog) %&gt;% eat(burrito, type = &quot;California&quot;) Here, we’ll use the pipe operator to complete steps 1 - 4 above in sequence: kelp_path &lt;- here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;) kelp_all_sites &lt;- kelp_path %&gt;% excel_sheets() %&gt;% set_names() %&gt;% purrr::map_df(read_excel, kelp_path) Check out kelp_all_sites, and notice that now the data from all 11 sites is now collected into a single data frame: kelp_all_sites ## # A tibble: 32 x 4 ## year month site total_fronds ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2016 7 abur 307 ## 2 2017 7 abur 604 ## 3 2018 7 abur 3532 ## 4 2016 7 ahnd 2572 ## 5 2017 7 ahnd 16 ## 6 2018 7 ahnd 16 ## 7 2016 7 aque 11152 ## 8 2017 7 aque 9194 ## 9 2018 7 aque 7754 ## 10 2016 7 bull 6706 ## # … with 22 more rows 5.2.7 Save data frames as .csv or .xlsx with write_csv() or write_xlsx() There are a number of reasons you might want to save (/export) data in a data frame as a .csv or Excel worksheet, including: To store raw data within the project you’re working in To store copies of intermediate data frames To convert your data back to a format that your coworkers/clients/colleagues will be able to use it more easily Use write_csv(object, &quot;file_name.csv&quot;) to write a data frame to a CSV, or write_xlsx(object, &quot;file_name.xlsx&quot;) to similarly export as a .xlsx (or .xls) worksheet. In the previous step, we combined all of our kelp frond observations into a single data frame. Wouldn’t it make sense to store a copy? As a CSV: write_csv(kelp_all_sites, here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_all_sites.csv&quot;)) A cool thing about write_csv() is that it just quietly works without wrecking anything else you do in a sequence, so it’s great to add at the end of a piped sequence. For example, if I want to read in the range cells C1:D3 ‘ivee’ worksheet from kelp_counts_curated.xlsx, then write that new subset to a .csv file, I can pipe all the way through: kelp_ivee_subset &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;), sheet = &quot;ivee&quot;, range = &quot;C1:D3&quot;) %&gt;% write_csv(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_ivee.csv&quot;)) Now I’ve created kelp_ivee_subset.csv, but the object kelp_ivee_subset also exists as an object for me to use in R. If needed, I can also export a data frame as an Excel (.xlsx) worksheet: write_xlsx(kelp_all_sites, here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_all_sites.xlsx&quot;)) 5.3 Activity: Import some invertebrates! There’s one dataset we haven’t imported or explored yet: invertebrate counts for 5 popular invertebrates (California cone snail, California spiny lobster, orange cup coral, purple urchin and rock scallops) at 11 sites in the Santa Barbara Channel. Take a look at the invert_counts_curated.xlsx data by opening it in Excel Read in the invert_counts_curated.xlsx worksheet as object ‘inverts_july’, only retaining site, common_name, and 2016 and setting the existing first row in the worksheet as to column headers upon import Explore the imported data frame using View, names, head, tail, etc. Write ‘inverts_july’ to a CSV file in your working directory called “inverts_july.csv” # Importing only &#39;site&#39; through &#39;2016&#39; columns: inverts_july &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;invert_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;), range = &quot;B1:D56&quot;) # Do some basic exploring (why might we want to do this in the Console instead?): View(inverts_july) names(inverts_july) head(inverts_july) tail(inverts_july) ls() # Writing a csv &quot;inverts_july.csv&quot;: write_csv(inverts_july, here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;inverts_july.csv&quot;)) 5.4 Efficiency Tips Add an assignment arrow in (&lt;-): Alt + minus (-) Undo shortcut: Command + Z Redo shortcut: Command + Shift + Z 5.5 Additional thoughts Economist article about gene &gt; dates issue in Excel Mine: data frame of bike casualities in NC, column names are age ranges but some of them import as dates Excel makes some wrong assumptions and doesn’t give you a heads up about its decision making "],
["ggplot2.html", "Chapter 6 Graphs with ggplot2 6.1 Summary 6.2 Lesson", " Chapter 6 Graphs with ggplot2 6.1 Summary Now that we know how to get some data, the next thing we’ll probably want to do is look at it. In Excel, graphs are made by manually selecting options - which, as we’ve discussed previously, may not be the best option for reproducibility. Also, if we haven’t built a graph with reproducible code, then we might not be able to easily recreate a graph or use that code again to make the same style graph with different data. Using ggplot2, the graphics package within the tidyverse, we’ll write reproducible code to manually and thoughtfully build our graphs. “ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.” - R4DS So yeah…that gg is from “grammar of graphics” - original source We’ll use the ggplot2 package, but the function we use to initialize a graph will be ggplot, which works best for data in tidy format (i.e., a column for every variable, and a row for every observation). Graphics with ggplot are built step-by-step, adding new elements as layers with a plus sign (+) between layers (note: this is different from the pipe operator, %&gt;%. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots. 6.1.1 Objectives Build several common types of graphs (scatterplot, column, line) in ggplot2 Customize gg-graph aesthetics (color, style, themes, etc.) Update axis labels and titles Combine compatible graph types (geoms) Build multiseries graphs Split up data into faceted graphs Exporting figures with ggsave() 6.1.2 Resources https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf Graphs with ggplot2 - Cookbook for R “Why I use ggplot2” - David Robinson Blog Post 6.2 Lesson 6.2.1 Getting started - Create a new .Rmd, attach packages &amp; get data Within your existing version-controlled R project, create a new R Markdown document with title “Data visualization with ggplot2.” Remove everything below the first code chunk. Knit and save the .Rmd file within your project working directory as “my_ggplot2”. The ggplot2 package is part of the tidyverse, so we don’t need to attach it separately. Attach the tidyverse, readxl and here packages in the top-most code chunk of your .Rmd. library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(here) In this session, we’ll use data for parks visitation from two files: A comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing visitation data for all National Parks in California (ca_np.csv) A single Excel worksheet containing only visitation for Channel Islands National Park (ci_np.xlsx) Add a new code chunk to read in the data from the data subfolder within your working directory. ca_np &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;ca_np.csv&quot;)) ci_np &lt;- read_xlsx(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;ci_np.xlsx&quot;)) Let’s take a quick look at the data to see what it contains. For example: View(): to look at the object in spreadsheet format names(): to see the variable (column) names summary(): see a quick summary of each variable 6.2.2 Our first ggplot graph: Visitors to Channel Islands NP To create a bare-bones ggplot graph, we need to tell R three basic things: We’re using ggplot Data we’re using &amp; variables we’re plotting (i.e., what is x and/or y?) What type of graph we’re making (the type of geom) Generally, that structure will look like this: ggplot(data = df_name, aes(x = x_var_name, y = y_var_name)) + geom_type() Breaking that down: First, tell R you’re using ggplot() Then, tell it the object name where variables exist (data = df_name) Next, tell it the aesthetics aes() to specify which variables you want to plot Then add a layer for the type of geom (graph type) with geom_*() - for example, geom_point() is a scatterplot, geom_line() is a line graph, geom_col() is a column graph, etc. Let’s do that to create a line graph of visitors to Channel Islands National Park: ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_line() Or, we could change that to a scatterplot just by updating the geom_*: ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_point() We could even do that for a column graph: ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_col() Or an area plot… ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_area() We can see that updating to different geom_* types is quick, so long as the types of graphs we’re switching between are compatible. The data are there, now let’s do some data viz customization. 6.2.3 Intro to customizing ggplot graphs First, we’ll customize some aesthetics (e.g. colors, styles, axis labels, etc.) of our graphs based on non-variable values. We can change the aesthetics of elements in a ggplot graph by adding arguments within the layer where that element is created. Some common arguments we’ll use first are: color = or colour =: update point or line colors fill =: update fill color for objects with areas linetype =: update the line type (dashed, long dash, etc.) pch =: update the point style size =: update the element size (e.g. of points or line thickness) alpha =: update element opacity (1 = opaque, 0 = transparent) Building on our first line graph, let’s update the line color to “purple” and make the line type “dashed”: ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_line( color = &quot;purple&quot;, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot; ) How do we know which color names ggplot will recognize? If you google “R colors ggplot2” you’ll find a lot of good resources. Here’s one: SAPE ggplot2 colors quick reference guide Now let’s update the point, style and size of points on our previous scatterplot graph using color =, size =, and pch = (see ?pch for the different point styles, which can be further customized). ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_point(color = &quot;purple&quot;, pch = 17, size = 4, alpha = 0.5) 6.2.3.1 Activity: customize your own ggplot graph Update one of the example graphs you created above to customize at least an element color and size! 6.2.4 Mapping variables onto aesthetics In the examples above, we have customized aesthetics based on constants that we input as arguments (e.g., the color / style / size isn’t changing based on a variable characteristic or value). Sometimes, however, we do want the aesthetics of a graph to depend on a variable. To do that, we’ll map variables onto graph aesthetics, meaning we’ll change how an element on the graph looks based on a variable characteristic (usually, character or value). When we want to customize a graph element based on a variable’s characteristic or value, add the argument within aes() in the appropriate geom_*() layer In short, if updating aesthetics based on a variable, make sure to put that argument inside of aes(). Example: Create a ggplot scatterplot graph where the size and color of the points change based on the number of visitors, and make all points the same level of opacity (alpha = 0.5). Notice the aes() around the size = and color = arguments. Also: this is overmapped and unnecessary. Avoid excessive / overcomplicated aesthetic mapping in data visualization. ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_point( aes(size = visitors, color = visitors), alpha = 0.5 ) In the example above, notice that the two arguments that do depend on variables are within aes(), but since alpha = 0.5 doesn’t depend on a variable then it is outside the aes() but still within the geom_point() layer. 6.2.4.1 Activity: map variables onto graph aesthetics Create a column plot of Channel Islands National Park visitation over time, where the fill color (argument: fill =) changes based on the number of visitors. ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_col(aes(fill = visitors)) Sync your project with your GitHub repo. 6.2.5 ggplot2 complete themes While every element of a ggplot graph is manually customizable, there are also built-in themes (theme_*()) that you can add to your ggplot code to make some major headway before making smaller tweaks manually. Here are a few to try today (but also notice all the options that appear as we start typing theme_ into our ggplot graph code!): theme_light() theme_minimal() theme_bw() Here, let’s update our previous graph with theme_minimal(): ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_point( aes(size = visitors, color = visitors), alpha = 0.5 ) + theme_minimal() 6.2.6 Updating axis labels and titles Use labs() to update axis labels, and add a title and/or subtitle to your ggplot graph. ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_line(linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs( x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Annual park visitors&quot;, title = &quot;Channel Islands NP Visitation&quot;, subtitle = &quot;(1963 - 2016)&quot; ) Note: If you want to update the formatting of axis values (for example, to convert to comma format instead of scientific format above), you can use the scales package options (see more from the R Cookbook). 6.2.7 Combining compatible geoms As long as the geoms are compatible, we can layer them on top of one another to further customize a graph. For example, adding points to a line graph: ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_line(color = &quot;purple&quot;) + geom_point(color = &quot;magenta&quot;, aes(size = year)) Or, combine a column and line graph (not sure why you’d want to do this, but you can): ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_col(fill = &quot;orange&quot;, color = &quot;purple&quot;) + geom_line() 6.2.8 Multi-series ggplot graphs In the examples above, we only had a single series - visitation at Channel Islands National Park. Often we’ll want to visualize multiple series. For example, from the ca_np object we have stored, we might want to plot visitation for all California National Parks. To do that, we need to add an aesthetic that lets ggplot know how things are going to be grouped. A demonstration of why that’s important - what happens if we don’t let ggplot know how to group things? ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + geom_line() Well that’s definitely a mess, and it’s because ggplot has no idea that these should be different series based on the different parks that appear in the ‘park_name’ column. We can make sure R does know by updating an aesthetic based on park_name: ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) + geom_line() Note: You could also add that aesthetic (color = park_name) in the geom_line() layer, instead of in the topmost ggplot() layer. 6.2.9 Faceting ggplot graphs When we facet graphs, we split them up into multiple plotting panels, where each panel contains a subset of the data. In our case, we’ll split the graph above into different panels, each containing visitation data for a single park. Also notice that any general theme changes made will be applied to all of the graphs. ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) + geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) + theme_light() + labs(x = &quot;year&quot;, y = &quot;annual visitors&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ park_name) 6.2.10 Exporting a ggplot graph with ggsave() If we want our graph to appear in a knitted html, then we don’t need to do anything else. But often we’ll need a saved image file, of specific size and resolution, to share or for publication. ggsave() will export the most recently run ggplot graph by default (plot = last_plot()), unless you give it the name of a different saved ggplot object. Some common arguments for ggsave(): width =: set exported image width (default inches) height =: set exported image height (default height) dpi =: set dpi (dots per inch) So to export the faceted graph above at 180 dpi, width a width of 8&quot; and a height of 7&quot;, we can use: ggsave(here(&quot;figures&quot;, &quot;np_graph.jpg&quot;), dpi = 180, width = 8, height = 7) Notice that a .jpg image of that name and size is now stored in your project working directory. You can change the type of exported image, too (e.g. pdf, tiff, eps, png, mmp, svg). 6.2.11 One final graph example: jitter and boxplots For the record: this is not a good option for showing the visitation data because values are not independent observations of a random variable. But, for the purposes of showing a graph, we’ll use visitation as our continuous measured variable in a jitter + boxplot anyway. ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = park_name, y = visitors)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = &quot;gray60&quot;, width = 0.2, size = 1) + geom_boxplot(fill = NA, color = &quot;black&quot;, outlier.color = NA) + coord_flip() + theme_minimal() Sync your project with your GitHub repo.

We will also learn how to format tables and practice creating a reproducible report using RMarkdown and sharing it with GitHub. 7.2 Objectives In R, we can use dplyr for pivot tables by using 2 main verbs in combination: group_by and summarize. We will also continue to emphasize reproducibility in all our analyses.

We will learn about this using data about lobsters and will go back and forth between R and Excel as we learn. Let’s start off in R, and have a look at the data. 7.5 RMarkdown setup Let’s start a new RMarkdown file in our repo, at the top-level (where it will be created by default in our Project). I’ll call mine pivot_lobsters.Rmd. In the setup chunk, let’s attach our libraries and read in our lobster data. In addition to the tidyverse package we will also use the skimr package. You will have to install it, but don’t want it to be installed every time you write your code. The following is a nice convention for having the install instructions available (on the same line) as the library() call. ## attach libraries library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(here) library(skimr) # install.packages(&#39;skimr&#39;) ## read in data lobsters &lt;- read_xlsx(here(&quot;data/lobsters.xlsx&quot;)) Let’s add a code chunk and explore the data in a few ways. # explore data head(lobsters) # year and month as well as a column for date ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## year month date site transect replicate size_mm ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 A 70 ## 2 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 60 ## 3 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 65 ## 4 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 70 ## 5 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 85 ## 6 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 60 head() gives us a look at the first rows of the data (6 by default). I like this because I can see the column names and get a sense of the shape of the data. I can also see the class of each column (double or character) In this data set, every row is a unique observation. This is called “uncounted” data; you’ll see there is no row for how many lobsters were seen because each row is an observation, or an “n of 1”. # explore data summary(lobsters) ## year month date site ## Min. :2012 Min. :8.000 Length:6366 Length:6366 ## 1st Qu.:2015 1st Qu.:8.000 Class :character Class :character ## Median :2017 Median :8.000 Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :2016 Mean :8.017 ## 3rd Qu.:2018 3rd Qu.:8.000 ## Max. :2018 Max. :9.000 ## ## transect replicate size_mm ## Min. :1.000 Length:6366 Min. : 18.00 ## 1st Qu.:2.000 Class :character 1st Qu.: 65.00 ## Median :4.000 Mode :character Median : 75.00 ## Mean :3.806 Mean : 73.02 ## 3rd Qu.:5.000 3rd Qu.: 82.00 ## Max. :9.000 Max. :183.00 ## NA&#39;s :6 summary gives us summary statistics for each variable (column). I like this for numeric columns, but it doesn’t give a lot of useful information for non-numeric data. To have a look there I like using the skimr package: # explore data skimr::skim(lobsters) Table 7.1: Data summary Name lobsters Number of rows 6366 Number of columns 7 _______________________ Column type frequency: character 3 numeric 4 ________________________ Group variables None Variable type: character skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max empty n_unique whitespace date 0 1 6 7 0 38 0 site 0 1 4 4 0 5 0 replicate 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 Variable type: numeric skim_variable n_missing complete_rate mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist year 0 1 2016.24 1.66 2012 2015 2017 2018 2018 ▁▁▂▂▇ month 0 1 8.02 0.13 8 8 8 8 9 ▇▁▁▁▁ transect 0 1 3.81 2.17 1 2 4 5 9 ▇▆▅▃▂ size_mm 6 1 73.02 13.61 18 65 75 82 183 ▁▇▂▁▁ This skimr:: notation is a reminder to me that skim is from the skimr package. It is a nice convention: it’s a reminder to others (especially you!). skim lets us look more at each variable. I particularly like looking at missing data. There are 6 missing values in the size_mm variable. We can also make a quick plot to have a look at these data, and use our new ggplot2 skills. Let’s make a bar chart by year for each site ggplot(lobsters, aes(x = year)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~site) (geom_bar() counts things and geom_col() is for values within the data (mean)) 7.5.1 Our task So this is all great to get a quick look. But what if we needed to report to someone about how the average size of lobsters has changed over time across sites? To answer this we need to do a pivot table in Excel, or data wrangling in R. Let’s start by having a quick look at what pivot tables can do in Excel. 7.6 Pivot table demo Let’s make a pivot table with our lobster data. Let’s start off with how many lobsters were counted each year. I want a count of rows by year. So to do this in Excel we would initiate the Pivot Table Process: And it will do its best to find the data I would like to include in my Pivot Table (it can have difficulty with non-rectangular or “non-tidy” data), and suggest we make this in a new sheet: And then we’ll get a little wizard to help us create the Pivot Table. 7.6.1 pivot one variable I want to summarize by year, so I drag “year” down into the “Rows” box, and to get the counts by year I actually drag the same variable, “year” into the “Values” box. And it will create a Pivot Table for me! But “sum” as the default summary statistic, so I can click the little “I” icon to change this to count. A few things to note: The pivot table is separate entity from our data (it’s on a different sheet); the original data has not been affected The pivot table only shows the variables we requested; we don’t see other columns (like date, month, or site). Notice that in Excel we retain the overall totals for each site (in bold, on the same line with the site name). This is nice for communicating about data. But it can be problematic for further analyses, because it could be easy to take a total of this column and introduce errors. So pivot tables are great because they summarize the data and keep the raw data raw — they even promote good pratice because they by default ask you if you’d like to present the data in a new sheet rather than in the same sheet. 7.6.2 pivot two variables We can also add site as a second variable by dragging it: And then can reverse the order by dragging: So in terms of our final interest of average size by site and year, we are on our way! I’m going to stop here because we want to be able to do this in R. The power of R is in the automation, and in keeping that raw data truly raw. Let’s talk about how this looks like in R. 7.7 group_by() %&gt;% summarize() In R, we can create the functionality of pivot tables by using 2 main dplyr verbs in combination: group_by and summarize. Say it with me: “pivot tables are group_by and then summarize”. And just like pivot tables, you have flexibility with how you are going to summarize. For example, we can calculate an average, or a total. I think it’s incredibly powerful to visualize what we are talking about with our data when do do these kinds of operations. It looks like this (from RStudio’s cheatsheet; all cheatsheets available from https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets): When we were reporting by year or site, we were essentially modifying what we were grouping by (the different colors here in this figure. Let’s do this in R. 7.7.1 group_by one variable Let’s try this on our lobsters data, just like we did in Excel. We will count the the total number of lobster by year. In R vocabulary, we will group_by year and then summarize by counting using n(), which is a function from dplyr. n() counts the number of times an observation shows up, and since this is uncounted data, this will count each row. We’ll also use the pipe operator %&gt;%, which you can read as “and then”. This to me reads: “take the lobsters data and then group_by year and then summarize by count in a new column called ‘count’” lobsters %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_year = n()) ## # A tibble: 7 x 2 ## year count_by_year ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2012 231 ## 2 2013 243 ## 3 2014 510 ## 4 2015 1100 ## 5 2016 809 ## 6 2017 1668 ## 7 2018 1805 Notice how together, group_by and summarize minimize the amount of information we see. We also saw this with the pivot table. We lose the other columns that aren’t involved here. Question: What if you don’t group_by first? Let’s try it and discuss what’s going on. lobsters %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## count ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 6366 So if we don’t group_by first, we will get a single summary statistic (sum in this case) for the whole dataset. Another question: what if we only group_by? lobsters %&gt;% group_by(year) ## # A tibble: 6,366 x 7 ## # Groups: year [7] ## year month date site transect replicate size_mm ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 A 70 ## 2 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 60 ## 3 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 65 ## 4 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 70 ## 5 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 85 ## 6 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 60 ## 7 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 65 ## 8 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 67 ## 9 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 D 70 ## 10 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 4 B 85 ## # … with 6,356 more rows 7.7.2 RStudio Viewer Let’s now check the lobsters variable. We can do this by clicking on lobsters in the Environment pane in RStudio. We see that we haven’t changed any of our original data that was stored in this variable. (Just like how the pivot table didn’t affect the raw data on the original sheet). Aside: You’ll also see that when you click on the variable name in the Environment pane, View(lobsters) shows up in your Console. View() (capital V) is the R function to view any variable in the viewer. So this is something that you can write in your RMarkdown script, although RMarkdown will not be able to knit this view feature into the formatted document. So, if you want include View() in your RMarkdown document you will need to either comment it out #View() or add eval=FALSE to the top of the code chunk so that the full line reads {r, eval=FALSE}. 7.7.3 group_by multiple variables Great. Now let’s summarize by both year and site like we did in the pivot table. We are able to group_by more than one variable. Let’s do this together: lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n()) ## # A tibble: 35 x 3 ## # Groups: site [5] ## site year count_by_siteyear ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 aque 2012 38 ## 2 aque 2013 32 ## 3 aque 2014 100 ## 4 aque 2015 83 ## 5 aque 2016 48 ## 6 aque 2017 67 ## 7 aque 2018 54 ## 8 carp 2012 78 ## 9 carp 2013 93 ## 10 carp 2014 79 ## # … with 25 more rows text. 7.7.4 summarize multiple variables We can summarize multiple variables at a time. So far we’ve done the count of lobster observations. Let’s also do the mean and standard deviation. First let’s use the mean() function to calculate the mean. We do this within the same summarize() function, but we can add a new line to make it easier to read. Notice how when you put your curser within the parenthesis and hit return, the indentation will automatically align. lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(), mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm)) ## # A tibble: 35 x 4 ## # Groups: site [5] ## site year count_by_siteyear mean_size_mm ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 aque 2012 38 71 ## 2 aque 2013 32 72.1 ## 3 aque 2014 100 76.9 ## 4 aque 2015 83 68.5 ## 5 aque 2016 48 68.7 ## 6 aque 2017 67 73.9 ## 7 aque 2018 54 71.7 ## 8 carp 2012 78 74.4 ## 9 carp 2013 93 76.6 ## 10 carp 2014 79 NA ## # … with 25 more rows Aside Command-I will properly indent selected lines. Great! But this will actually calculate some of the means as NA because one or more values in that year are NA. So we can pass an argument that says to remove NAs first before calculating the average. Let’s do that, and then also calculate the standard deviation with the sd() function: lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(), mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 35 x 5 ## # Groups: site [5] ## site year count_by_siteyear mean_size_mm sd_size_mm ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 aque 2012 38 71 10.2 ## 2 aque 2013 32 72.1 12.3 ## 3 aque 2014 100 76.9 9.32 ## 4 aque 2015 83 68.5 12.6 ## 5 aque 2016 48 68.7 12.5 ## 6 aque 2017 67 73.9 11.9 ## 7 aque 2018 54 71.7 8.14 ## 8 carp 2012 78 74.4 14.6 ## 9 carp 2013 93 76.6 8.71 ## 10 carp 2014 79 79.1 8.57 ## # … with 25 more rows So we can make the equivalent of Excel’s pivot table in R with group_by and then summarize. But a powerful thing about R is that maybe we want this information to be used in further analyses. We can make this easier for ourselves by saving this as a variable. So let’s add a variable assignment to that first line: siteyear_summary &lt;- lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(), mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) siteyear_summary ## # A tibble: 35 x 5 ## # Groups: site [5] ## site year count_by_siteyear mean_size_mm sd_size_mm ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 aque 2012 38 71 10.2 ## 2 aque 2013 32 72.1 12.3 ## 3 aque 2014 100 76.9 9.32 ## 4 aque 2015 83 68.5 12.6 ## 5 aque 2016 48 68.7 12.5 ## 6 aque 2017 67 73.9 11.9 ## 7 aque 2018 54 71.7 8.14 ## 8 carp 2012 78 74.4 14.6 ## 9 carp 2013 93 76.6 8.71 ## 10 carp 2014 79 79.1 8.57 ## # … with 25 more rows 7.7.5 Activity Calculate the median size_mm (Hint: ?median) and create and ggsave() a plot. Then, save, commit, and push your .Rmd, .html, and .png. Solution (no peeking): siteyear_summary &lt;- lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(), mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) siteyear_summary ## a ggplot option: ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) + geom_line() ggsave(here(&quot;figures&quot;, &quot;lobsters-line.png&quot;)) ## another option: ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~site) ggsave(here(&quot;figures&quot;, &quot;lobsters-col.png&quot;)) Don’t forget to knit, commit, and push! Nice work everybody. 7.8 Oh no, our colleague sent the wrong data! Oh no! After all our analyses and everything we’ve done, our colleague just emailed us at 4:30pm on Friday that he sent the wrong data and we need to redo all our analyses with a new .xlsx file: lobsters2.xlsx, not lobsters.xlsx. Aaaaah! If we were doing this in Excel, this would be a bummer; we’d have to rebuild our pivot table and click through all of our logic again. And then export our figures and save them into our report. But, since we did it in R, we are much safer. We can go back to the top of our RMarkdown file, and read in the updated dataset, and then re-knit. We will still need to check that everything outputs correctly, (and that column headers haven’t been renamed), but our first pass will be to update the filename and re-knit: ## read in data lobsters &lt;- read_xlsx(here(&quot;data/lobsters2.xlsx&quot;)) And now we can see that our plot updated as well: siteyear_summary &lt;- lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(count_by_siteyear = n(), mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), ) siteyear_summary ## # A tibble: 35 x 6 ## # Groups: site [5] ## site year count_by_siteyear mean_size_mm sd_size_mm median_size_mm ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 aque 2012 38 71 10.2 70 ## 2 aque 2013 32 72.1 12.3 75 ## 3 aque 2014 100 76.9 9.32 75.5 ## 4 aque 2015 83 68.5 12.6 70 ## 5 aque 2016 48 68.7 12.5 71 ## 6 aque 2017 67 73.9 11.9 75 ## 7 aque 2018 54 71.7 8.14 72 ## 8 carp 2012 78 74.4 14.6 74.5 ## 9 carp 2013 93 76.6 8.71 76 ## 10 carp 2014 79 79.1 8.57 79 ## # … with 25 more rows ## a ggplot option: ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) + geom_line() ggsave(here(&quot;figures&quot;, &quot;lobsters-line.png&quot;)) ## Saving 7 x 5 in image ## another option: ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(~site) ggsave(here(&quot;figures&quot;, &quot;lobsters-col.png&quot;)) ## Saving 7 x 5 in image 7.8.1 Knit, push, &amp; show differences on GitHub So cool. 7.8.2 dplyr::count() Now that we’ve spent time with group_by %&gt;% summarize, there is a shortcut if you only want to summarize by count. This is with a function called count(), and it will group_by your selected variable, count, and then also ungroup. It looks like this: lobsters %&gt;% count(site, year) ## This is the same as: lobsters %&gt;% group_by(site, year) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) %&gt;% ungroup() Switching gears… 7.9 mutate() There are a lot of times where you don’t want to summarize your data, but you do want to operate beyond the original data. This is often done by adding a column. We do this with the mutate() function from dplyr. Let’s try this with our original lobsters data. The sizes are in millimeters but let’s say it was important for them to be in meters. We can add a column with this calculation: # quick reminder what this looks like head(lobsters) ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## year month date site transect replicate size_mm ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 A 70 ## 2 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 60 ## 3 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 65 ## 4 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 70 ## 5 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 85 ## 6 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 60 lobsters %&gt;% mutate(size_m = size_mm / 1000) ## # A tibble: 6,366 x 8 ## year month date site transect replicate size_mm size_m ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 A 70 0.07 ## 2 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 60 0.06 ## 3 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 65 0.065 ## 4 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 70 0.07 ## 5 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 B 85 0.085 ## 6 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 60 0.06 ## 7 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 65 0.065 ## 8 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 C 67 0.067 ## 9 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 3 D 70 0.07 ## 10 2012 8 8/20/12 ivee 4 B 85 0.085 ## # … with 6,356 more rows If we want to add a column that has the same value repeated, we can pass it just one value, either a number or a character string (in quotes). And let’s save this as a variable called lobsters_detailed lobsters_detailed &lt;- lobsters %&gt;% mutate(size_m = size_mm / 1000, millenia = 2000, observer = &quot;Allison Horst&quot;) 7.10 select() We will end with one final function, select. This is how to choose, retain, and move your data by columns: Let’s say that we want to present this data finally with only columns for date, site, and size in meters. We would do this: lobsters_detailed %&gt;% select(date, site, size_m) ## # A tibble: 6,366 x 3 ## date site size_m ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 8/20/12 ivee 0.07 ## 2 8/20/12 ivee 0.06 ## 3 8/20/12 ivee 0.065 ## 4 8/20/12 ivee 0.07 ## 5 8/20/12 ivee 0.085 ## 6 8/20/12 ivee 0.06 ## 7 8/20/12 ivee 0.065 ## 8 8/20/12 ivee 0.067 ## 9 8/20/12 ivee 0.07 ## 10 8/20/12 ivee 0.085 ## # … with 6,356 more rows One last time, let’s knit, save, commit, and push to GitHub. 7.11 Deep thoughts Highly recommended read: Broman &amp; Woo: Data organization in spreadsheets.

Here, we’ll continue by reshaping data frames (converting from long-to-wide, or wide-to-long format), separating and uniting variable (column) contents, converting between explicit and implicit missing (NA) values, and cleaning up our column names with the janitor package. 8.2 Objectives Reshape data frames with tidyr::pivot_wider() and tidyr::pivot_longer() Convert column names with janitor::clean_names() Combine or separate information from columns with tidyr::unite() and tidyr::separate() Make implicit missings explicit with tidyr::complete() Make explicit missings implicit with tidyr::drop_na() Use our new skills as part of a bigger wrangling sequence Make a customized table (TODO: or introduce Kable if not time in pivot tables chapter) 8.3 Resources – Ch. 12 Tidy Data, in R for Data Science by Grolemund &amp; Wickham - tidyr documentation from tidyverse.org - janitor repo / information from Sam Firke 8.4 Lesson 8.4.1 Lesson Prep 8.4.1.1 Create a new R Markdown and attach packages Within your day 2 R Project, create a new .Rmd. Attach the tidyverse, janitor and readxl packages with library(package_name). Knit and save your new .Rmd within the project folder. # Attach packages library(tidyverse) library(janitor) library(readxl) 8.4.1.2 Read in data Use readxl::read_excel() to import the “invert_counts_curated.xlsx” data: inverts_df &lt;- readxl::read_excel(&quot;invert_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;) Be sure to explore the imported data a bit: View() names() summary() 8.4.2 Reshaping with tidyr::pivot_longer() and tidyr::pivot_wider() 8.4.2.1 Wide-to-longer format with tidyr::pivot_longer() In tidy format, each variable is contained within a single column. If we look at inverts_df, we can see that the year variable is actually split over 3 columns, so we’d say this is currently in wide format. There may be times when you want to have data in wide format, but often with code it is more efficient to convert to long format by gathering together observations for a variable that is currently split into multiple columns. Schematically, converting from wide to long format looks like this: Generally, the code to gather wide columns together using tidyr::pivot_longer() looks like this: TODO: Add pivot_longer() schematic We’ll use tidyr::pivot_longer() to gather data from all years in inverts_df into two columns: one called year, which contains the year (as a number), and another called sp_count that contains the number of each species observed. The new data frame will be stored as inverts_long: inverts_long &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer(data = inverts_df, cols = &#39;2016&#39;:&#39;2018&#39;, names_to = &quot;year&quot;, values_to = &quot;sp_count&quot;) The outcome is the new long-format inverts_long data frame: inverts_long ## # A tibble: 165 x 5 ## month site common_name year sp_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 abur california cone snail 2016 451 ## 2 7 abur california cone snail 2017 28 ## 3 7 abur california cone snail 2018 762 ## 4 7 abur california spiny lobster 2016 17 ## 5 7 abur california spiny lobster 2017 17 ## 6 7 abur california spiny lobster 2018 16 ## 7 7 abur orange cup coral 2016 24 ## 8 7 abur orange cup coral 2017 24 ## 9 7 abur orange cup coral 2018 24 ## 10 7 abur purple urchin 2016 48 ## # … with 155 more rows Hooray, long format! One thing that isn’t obvious at first (but would become obvious if you continued working with this data) is that since those year numbers were initially column names (characters), when they are stacked into the year column, their class wasn’t auto-updated to numeric. Explore the class of year in inverts_long: class(inverts_long$year) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; We’ll use dplyr::mutate() in a different way here: to create a new column (that’s how we’ve used mutate() previously) that has the same name of an existing column, in order to update and overwrite the existing column. In this case, we’ll mutate() to add a column called year, which contains an as.numeric() version of the existing year variable: # Coerce &quot;year&quot; class to numeric: inverts_long &lt;- inverts_long %&gt;% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) Checking the class again, we see that year has been updated to a numeric variable: class(inverts_long$year) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; 8.4.2.2 Long-to-wider format with tidyr::pivot_wider() In the previous example, we had information spread over multiple columns that we wanted to gather. Sometimes, we’ll have data that we want to spread over multiple columns. For example, imagine that starting from inverts_long we want each species in the common_name column to exist as its own column. In that case, we would be converting from a longer to a wider format, and will use tidyr::pivot_wider() as follows: TODO: Add pivot_wider() schematic Specifically for our data, we write code to spread the common_name column as follows: inverts_wide &lt;- inverts_long %&gt;% tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = common_name, values_from = sp_count) inverts_wide ## # A tibble: 33 x 8 ## month site year `california con… `california spi… `orange cup cor… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 abur 2016 451 17 24 ## 2 7 abur 2017 28 17 24 ## 3 7 abur 2018 762 16 24 ## 4 7 ahnd 2016 27 16 24 ## 5 7 ahnd 2017 24 16 24 ## 6 7 ahnd 2018 24 16 24 ## 7 7 aque 2016 4971 48 1526 ## 8 7 aque 2017 1752 48 1623 ## 9 7 aque 2018 2616 48 1859 ## 10 7 bull 2016 1735 24 36 ## # … with 23 more rows, and 2 more variables: `purple urchin` &lt;dbl&gt;, `rock ## # scallop` &lt;dbl&gt; We can see that now each species has its own column (wider format). But also notice that those column headers (since they have spaces) might not be in the most coder-friendly format… 8.4.2.3 Meet the janitor package The janitor package by Sam Firke is a brilliant collection of functions for some quick data cleaning. We recommend that you explore the different functions it contains. Like: janitor::clean_names(): update column headers to a case of your choosing janitor::get_dupes(): see all rows that are duplicates within variables you choose janitor::remove_empty(): remove empty rows and/or columns janitor::andorn_*(): jazz up frequency tables of counts (we’ll return to this for a table example in TODO: Session 8) …and more! Here, we’ll use janitor::clean_names() to convert all of our column headers to a more convenient case - the default is lower_snake_case, which means all spaces and symbols are replaced with an underscore (or a word describing the symbol), all characters are lowercase, and a few other nice adjustments. For example, janitor::clean_names() would update these nightmare column names into much nicer forms: My...RECENT-income! becomes my_recent_income SAMPLE2.!test1 becomes sample2_test1 ThisIsTheName becomes this_is_the_name 2015 becomes x2015 If we wanted to then use these columns (which we probably would, since we created them), we could clean the names to get them into more coder-friendly lower_snake_case with janitor::clean_names(): inverts_wide &lt;- inverts_wide %&gt;% janitor::clean_names() names(inverts_wide) ## [1] &quot;month&quot; &quot;site&quot; ## [3] &quot;year&quot; &quot;california_cone_snail&quot; ## [5] &quot;california_spiny_lobster&quot; &quot;orange_cup_coral&quot; ## [7] &quot;purple_urchin&quot; &quot;rock_scallop&quot; And there are other options for the case, like: “snake” produces snake_case “lower_camel” or “small_camel” produces lowerCamel “upper_camel” or “big_camel” produces UpperCamel “screaming_snake” or “all_caps” produces ALL_CAPS “lower_upper” produces lowerUPPER “upper_lower” produces UPPERlower 8.4.3 Combine or separate information in columns with tidyr::unite() and tidyr::separate() Sometimes we’ll want to separate contents of a single column into multiple columns, or combine entries from different columns into a single column. For example, the following data frame has genus and species in separate columns: id genus species common_name 1 Scorpaena guttata sculpin 2 Sebastes miniatus vermillion We may want to combine the genus and species into a single column, scientific_name: id scientific_name common_name 1 Scorpaena guttata sculpin 2 Sebastes miniatus vermillion Or we may want to do the reverse (separate information from a single column into multiple columns). Here, we’ll learn tidyr::unite() and tidyr::separate() to help us do both. 8.4.3.1 tidyr::unite() to merge information from separate columns Use tidyr::unite() to combine (paste) information from multiple columns into a single column (as for the scientific name example above) To demonstrate uniting information from separate columns, we’ll make a single column that has the combined information from site abbreviation and year in inverts_wide. We need to give tidyr::unite() several arguments: data: the data frame containing columns we want to combine (or pipe into the function from the data frame) col: the name of the new “united” column the columns you are uniting sep: the symbol, value or character to put between the united information from each column inverts_unite &lt;- inverts_wide %&gt;% tidyr::unite(col = &quot;site_year&quot;, # What to name the new united column c(site, year), # The columns we&#39;ll unite (site, year) sep = &quot;_&quot;) # How to separate the things we&#39;re uniting ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## month site_year california_cone… california_spin… orange_cup_coral ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 abur_2016 451 17 24 ## 2 7 abur_2017 28 17 24 ## 3 7 abur_2018 762 16 24 ## 4 7 ahnd_2016 27 16 24 ## 5 7 ahnd_2017 24 16 24 ## 6 7 ahnd_2018 24 16 24 ## # … with 2 more variables: purple_urchin &lt;dbl&gt;, rock_scallop &lt;dbl&gt; Try updating the separator from &quot;_&quot; to “hello!” to see what the outcome column contains. tidyr::unite() can also combine information from more than two columns. For example, to combine the site, common_name and year columns from inverts_long, we could use: # Uniting more than 2 columns: inverts_triple_unite &lt;- inverts_long %&gt;% tidyr::unite(col = &quot;year_site_name&quot;, c(year, site, common_name), sep = &quot;-&quot;) head(inverts_triple_unite) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## month year_site_name sp_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 2016-abur-california cone snail 451 ## 2 7 2017-abur-california cone snail 28 ## 3 7 2018-abur-california cone snail 762 ## 4 7 2016-abur-california spiny lobster 17 ## 5 7 2017-abur-california spiny lobster 17 ## 6 7 2018-abur-california spiny lobster 16 8.4.3.2 tidyr::separate() to separate information into multiple columns While tidyr::unite() allows us to combine information from multiple columns, it’s more likely that you’ll start with a single column that you want to split up into pieces. For example, I might want to split up a column containing the genus and species (Scorpaena guttata) into two separate columns (Scorpaena | guttata), so that I can count how many Scorpaena organisms exist in my dataset at the genus level. Use tidyr::separate() to “separate a character column into multiple columns using a regular expression separator.” Let’s start again with inverts_unite, where we have combined the site and year into a single column called site_year. If we want to separate those, we can use: inverts_sep &lt;- inverts_triple_unite %&gt;% tidyr::separate(year_site_name, into = c(&quot;my_year&quot;, &quot;my_site_name&quot;)) ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 165 rows [1, 2, 3, 4, ## 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ...]. What is that warning Expected 2 pieces... telling us? If we take a look at the resulting data frame inverts_sep, we see that it only keeps the first two pieces, and gets rid of the third (name). Which is a bit concerning, because we rarely want to just throw away information in a data frame. head(inverts_sep) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## month my_year my_site_name sp_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 2016 abur 451 ## 2 7 2017 abur 28 ## 3 7 2018 abur 762 ## 4 7 2016 abur 17 ## 5 7 2017 abur 17 ## 6 7 2018 abur 16 That’s problematic. How can we make sure we’re keeping as many different elements as exist in the united column? We have a couple of options: Create the number of columns that are needed to retain as many elements as exist (in this case, 3, but we only created two new columns in the example above) inverts_sep3 &lt;- inverts_triple_unite %&gt;% tidyr::separate(year_site_name, into = c(&quot;the_year&quot;, &quot;the_site&quot;, &quot;the_name&quot;)) ## Warning: Expected 3 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 165 rows [1, 2, 3, 4, ## 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ...]. Another warning. What is that about? Let’s take a look at the resulting data frame and think about what’s missing (what are the “pieces discarded”?): head(inverts_sep3) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## month the_year the_site the_name sp_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 2016 abur california 451 ## 2 7 2017 abur california 28 ## 3 7 2018 abur california 762 ## 4 7 2016 abur california 17 ## 5 7 2017 abur california 17 ## 6 7 2018 abur california 16 Aha! Only the first word of the common name was retained, and anything else was trashed. We want to keep everything after the second dash in the new the_name column. That’s because the default is extra = &quot;warn&quot;, which means that if you have more pieces than columns you’re separating into, it will populate the columns that have been allotted (in our case, just 3) then drop any additional information, giving you a warning that pieces have been dropped. To keep the extra pieces that have been dropped, add the extra = &quot;merge&quot; argument within tidyr::separate() to override: inverts_sep_all &lt;- inverts_triple_unite %&gt;% separate(year_site_name, into = c(&quot;sample_year&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;sp_name&quot;), extra = &quot;merge&quot;) No warning there about things being discarded. Explore inverts_sep_all: ## # A tibble: 165 x 5 ## month sample_year location sp_name sp_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 2016 abur california cone snail 451 ## 2 7 2017 abur california cone snail 28 ## 3 7 2018 abur california cone snail 762 ## 4 7 2016 abur california spiny lobster 17 ## 5 7 2017 abur california spiny lobster 17 ## 6 7 2018 abur california spiny lobster 16 ## 7 7 2016 abur orange cup coral 24 ## 8 7 2017 abur orange cup coral 24 ## 9 7 2018 abur orange cup coral 24 ## 10 7 2016 abur purple urchin 48 ## # … with 155 more rows We see that the resulting data frame has split year_site_name into three separate columns, sample_year, location, and sp_name, but now everything after the second break (“-”) remains together in sp_name instead of dropping pieces following the third word. 8.4.4 Convert between explicit and implicit missings (NAs) An explicit missing is when every possible outcome actually appears in a data frame as a row, even if a variable of interest for that row is missing (NA). Conversely, an implicit missing is when an observation (row) does not appear in the data frame because a variable of interest contains an NA missing value. Consider the following data: day animal food_choice Monday eagle fish Monday mountain lion squirrel Monday toad NA Tuesday eagle fish Tuesday mountain lion deer Tuesday toad flies Notice that the row for toad still appears in the dataset for Tuesday, despite having a missing food choice for that day. This is an explicit missing because the row still appears in the data frame. If that row was removed, the resulting dataset would look like this: df_missings %&gt;% drop_na(food_choice) %&gt;% kable() day animal food_choice Monday eagle fish Monday mountain lion squirrel Tuesday eagle fish Tuesday mountain lion deer Tuesday toad flies …and if your reaction is “But then how do I know there’s a toad from MONDAY?”, then you can see how it can be a bit risky to have implicit missings instead of explicit missings. Whichever we choose, we can convert between the two forms using tidyr::drop_na() or tidyr::complete(): tidyr::drop_na(): removes observations (rows) that contain NA for variable(s) of interest tidyr::complete(): turns implicit missing values into explicit missing values by completing a data frame with missing combinations of data We’ll use both here, starting with the inverts_long data frame we created above. Looking through inverts_long, we’ll see that there are NA observations for every species at site bull in 2018 - but those NA counts do show up. First, we’ll use tidyr::drop_na() to make those missings implicit (invisible) instead: inverts_implicit_NA &lt;- inverts_long %&gt;% drop_na(sp_count) See that now, the rows that contained an NA in the sp_count column from inverts_long have been removed. WAIT, I want them back! We can ask R to create explicit missings (by identifying which combinations of groups currently don’t appear in the data frame) using tidyr::complete(): inverts_explicit_NA &lt;- inverts_implicit_NA %&gt;% complete(month, site, common_name, year) Now you’ll see inverts_explicit_NA has those 5 “missing” observations shown in the data frame. 8.4.5 Activities TODO 8.4.6 Fun facts / insights TODO "],

We’ve used: count(): get counts of observations for groupings we specify mutate(): add a new column, while keeping the existing ones group_by(): let R know that groups exist within the dataset, by variable(s) summarize(): calculate a value (that you specify) for each group, then report each group’s value in a table In this session, we’ll expand our data wrangling toolkit using: filter() to conditionally subset our data by rows, and *_join() functions to merge data frames together The combination of filter() and *_join() - to return rows satisfying a condition we specify, and merging data frames by like variables - is analogous to the useful VLOOKUP function in Excel. 9.1.1 Objectives Use filter() to subset data frames, returning rows that satisfy variable conditions Use full_join(), left_join(), and inner_join() to merge data frames, with different endpoints in mind Use filter() and *_join() as part of a wrangling sequence 9.1.2 Resources filter() documentation from tidyverse.org join() documentation from tidyverse.org Chapters 5 and 13 in R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham 9.2 Lessons 9.2.1 Getting started - Create a new .Rmd, attach packages &amp; get data Create a new R Markdown document in your r-workshop project and knit to save as filter_join.Rmd. Remove all the example code (everything below the set-up code chunk). In this session, we’ll use three packages: tidyverse readxl here Attach the packages in the setup code chunk in your .Rmd: # Attach packages: library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(here) Then create a new code chunk to read in three files from your ‘data’ subfolder: invert_counts_curated.xlsx fish_counts_curated.csv kelp_counts_curated.xlsx # Read in data: invert_counts &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;invert_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;)) fish_counts &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;fish_counts_curated.csv&quot;)) kelp_counts_abur &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;kelp_counts_curated.xlsx&quot;)) We should always explore the data we’ve read in using functions like View(), names(), summary(), head() and tail() to ensure that the data we think we’ve read in is actually the data we’ve read in. Now, let’s use filter() to decide which observations (rows) we’ll keep or exclude in new subsets, similar to using Excel’s VLOOKUP function. 9.2.2 filter() to conditionally subset by rows Use filter() to let R know which rows you want to keep or exclude, based whether or not their contents match conditions that you set for one or more variables. Some examples in words that might inspire you to use filter(): “I only want to keep rows where the temperature is greater than 90°F.” “I want to keep all observations except those where the tree type is listed as unknown.” “I want to make a new subset with only data for mountain lions (the species variable) in California (the state variable).” When we use filter(), we need to let R know a couple of things: What data frame we’re filtering from What condition(s) we want observations to match and/or not match in order to keep them in the new subset Here, we’ll learn some common ways to use filter(). 9.2.2.1 Filter rows by matching a single character string Let’s say we want to keep all observations from the fish_counts data frame where the common name is “garibaldi.” Here, we need to tell R to only keep rows from the fish_counts data frame when the common name (common_name variable) exactly matches garibaldi. Use == to ask R to look for matching strings: fish_garibaldi &lt;- filter(fish_counts, common_name == &quot;garibaldi&quot;) Check out the fish_garibaldi object to ensure that only garibaldi observations remain. You could also do this using the pipe operator %&gt;%: fish_garibaldi &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(common_name == &quot;garibaldi&quot;) 9.2.2.2 Activity Task: Create a subset from the fish_counts data frame, stored as object fish_abur, that only contains observations from Arroyo Burro (site ‘abur’). Solution: fish_abur &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(site == &quot;abur&quot;) Explore the subset you just created to ensure that only Arroyo Burro observations are returned. 9.2.2.3 Filter rows based on numeric conditions Use expected operators (&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==) to set conditions for a numeric variable when filtering. For this example, we only want to retain observations when the total_count column value is &gt;= 50: fish_over50 &lt;- filter(fish_counts, total_count &gt;= 50) Or, using the pipe: fish_over50 &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(total_count &gt;= 50) 9.2.2.4 Filter to return rows that match this OR that OR that What if we want to return a subset of the fish_counts df that contains garibaldi, blacksmith OR black surfperch? There are several ways to write an “OR” statement for filtering, which will keep any observations that match Condition A or Condition B or Condition C. In this example, we will create a subset from fish_counts that only contains rows where the common_name is garibaldi or blacksmith or black surfperch. Use %in% to ask R to look for any matches within a combined vector of strings: fish_3sp &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(common_name %in% c(&quot;garibaldi&quot;, &quot;blacksmith&quot;, &quot;black surfperch&quot;)) Alternatively, you can indicate OR using the vertical line operator | to do the same thing (but you can see that it’s more repetitive when looking for matches within the same variable): fish_3sp &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(common_name == &quot;garibaldi&quot; | common_name == &quot;blacksmith&quot; | common_name == &quot;black surfperch&quot;) 9.2.2.5 Filter to return rows that match conditions for multiple variables In the previous examples, we set filter conditions based on a single variable (e.g. common_name). What if we want to return observations that satisfy conditions for multiple variables? For example: We want to create a subset that only returns rows from ‘invert_counts’ where the site is “abur” or “mohk” and the common_name is “purple urchin.” In filter(), add a comma (or ampersand, &amp;) between arguments for multiple AND conditions: urchin_abur_mohk &lt;- invert_counts %&gt;% filter(site %in% c(&quot;abur&quot;,&quot;mohk&quot;), common_name == &quot;purple urchin&quot;) head(urchin_abur_mohk) ## # A tibble: 2 x 6 ## month site common_name `2016` `2017` `2018` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 abur purple urchin 48 48 48 ## 2 7 mohk purple urchin 620 505 323 Like most things in R, there are other ways to do the same thing. For example, you could do the same thing using &amp; (instead of a comma) between “and” conditions: # Use the ampersand (&amp;) to add another condition &quot;and this must be true&quot;: urchin_abur_mohk &lt;- invert_counts %&gt;% filter(site %in% c(&quot;abur&quot;,&quot;mohk&quot;) &amp; common_name == &quot;purple urchin&quot;) Or you could just do two filter steps in sequence: # Written as sequential filter steps: urchin_abur_mohk &lt;- invert_counts %&gt;% filter(site %in% c(&quot;abur&quot;, &quot;mohk&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(common_name == &quot;purple urchin&quot;) 9.2.2.5.1 Activity: combined filter conditions Task: Create a subset from the fish_counts data frame, called low_gb_wr that only contains: Observations of garibaldi and rock wrasse Where the total_count is less than or equal to 10 Solution: low_gb_wr &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(common_name %in% c(&quot;garibaldi&quot;, &quot;rock wrasse&quot;), total_count &lt;= 10) Sync your local project to your repo on GitHub. 9.2.2.6 Filter to return rows that do not match conditions Sometimes we might want to exclude observations. Here, let’s say we want to make a subset that contains all rows from fish_counts except those recorded at the Mohawk Reef site (“mohk” in the site variable). We use != to return observations that do not match a condition. Like this: fish_no_mohk &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(site != &quot;mohk&quot;) This similarly works to exclude observations by a value. For example, if we want to return all observations except those where the total fish count is 1, we use: fish_more_one &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(total_count != 1) What if we want to exclude observations for multiple conditions? For example, here we want to return all rows where the fish species is not garibaldi or rock wrasse. We can use filter(!variable %in% c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) to return rows where the variable does not match “apple” or “orange”. For our fish example, that looks like this: fish_subset &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(!common_name %in% c(&quot;garibaldi&quot;, &quot;rock wrasse&quot;)) Which then only returns observations for the other fish species in the dataset. head(fish_subset) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## year site common_name total_count ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2016 abur black surfperch 2 ## 2 2016 abur blacksmith 1 ## 3 2016 abur senorita 58 ## 4 2016 aque black surfperch 1 ## 5 2016 aque blacksmith 1 ## 6 2016 aque senorita 57 9.2.2.7 Example: combining filter() with other functions using the pipe operator (%&gt;%) We can also use filter() in combination with the functions we previously learned for wrangling. If we have multiple sequential steps to perform, we can string them together using the pipe operator (%&gt;%). Here, we’ll start with the invert_counts data frame and create a subset that: Converts to long(er) format with pivot_longer() Only keeps observations for rock scallops Calculates the total count of rock scallops by site only # Counts of scallops by site (all years included): scallop_count_by_site &lt;- invert_counts %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = &#39;2016&#39;:&#39;2018&#39;, names_to = &quot;year&quot;, values_to = &quot;sp_count&quot;) %&gt;% filter(common_name == &quot;rock scallop&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(site) %&gt;% summarize(tot_count = sum(sp_count, na.rm = TRUE)) scallop_count_by_site ## # A tibble: 11 x 2 ## site tot_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 abur 48 ## 2 ahnd 48 ## 3 aque 152 ## 4 bull 48 ## 5 carp 2519 ## 6 golb 48 ## 7 ivee 169 ## 8 mohk 346 ## 9 napl 6416 ## 10 scdi 2390 ## 11 sctw 1259 9.2.3 Merging data frames with *_join() Excel’s VLOOKUP can also be used to merge data from separate tables or worksheets. Here, we’ll use the *_join() functions to merge separate data frames in R. There are a number of ways to merge data frames in R. We’ll use full_join(), left_join(), and inner_join() in this session. From R Documentation (?join): full_join(): “returns all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.” Basically, nothing gets thrown out, even if a match doesn’t exist - making full_join() the safest option for merging data frames. When in doubt, full_join(). left_join(): “return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.” inner_join(): “returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.” This will drop observations that don’t have a match between the merged data frames, which makes it a riskier merging option if you’re not sure what you’re trying to do. Schematic (from RStudio data wrangling cheat sheet): To clarify what the different joins are doing, let’s first make a subset of the fish_counts data frame that only contains observations from 2016 and 2017. fish_2016_2017 &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% filter(year == 2016 | year == 2017) Take a look to ensure that only those years are included with View(fish_2016_2017). Now, let’s merge it with our kelp fronds data in different ways. 9.2.3.1 full_join() to merge data frames, keeping everything When we join data frames in R, we need to tell R a couple of things (and it does the hard joining work for us): Which data frames we want to merge together Which variables to merge by Note: If there are exactly matching column names in the data frames you’re merging, the *_join() functions will assume that you want to join by those columns. If there are no matching column names, you can specify which columns to join by manually. We’ll do both here. # Join the fish_counts and kelp_counts_abur together: abur_kelp_join &lt;- fish_2016_2017 %&gt;% full_join(kelp_counts_abur, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;site&quot;)) # Uh oh. An error message. When we try to do that join, we get an error message: Error: Can't join on 'year' x 'year' because of incompatible types (character / numeric) Let’s google this. That means copying this from the console and pasting it into Google. What’s going on here? First, there’s something fishy (ha) going on with the class of the year variable in kelp_counts_abur. Use the class() function to see how R understands that variable (remember, we use $ to return a specific column from a data frame). class(kelp_counts_abur$year) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; So the variable is currently stored as a character. Why? If we go back to the kelp_counts_curated.xlsx file, we’ll see that the numbers in both the year and month column have been stored as text. There are several hints Excel gives us: Cells are left aligned, when values stored as numbers are right aligned The green triangles in the corner indicate some formatting The warning sign shows up when you click on one of the values with text formatting, and lets you know that the cell has been stored as text. We are given the option to reformat as numeric in Excel, but we’ll do it here in R so we have a reproducible record of the change to the variable class. There are a number of ways to do this in R. We’ll use mutate() to overwrite the existing year column while coercing it to class numeric using the as.numeric() function. # Coerce the class of &#39;year&#39; to numeric kelp_counts_abur &lt;- kelp_counts_abur %&gt;% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) Now if we check the class of the year variable in kelp_counts_abur, we’ll see that it has been coerced to ‘numeric’: class(kelp_counts_abur$year) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Question: Isn’t it bad practice to overwrite variables, instead of just making a new one? Great question, and usually the answer is yes. Here, we feel fine with “overwriting” the year column because we’re not changing anything about what’s contained within the column, we’re only changing how R understands it. Always use caution if overwriting variables, and if in doubt, add one instead! OK, so now the class of year in the data frames we’re joining is the same. Let’s try that full_join() again: abur_kelp_join &lt;- fish_2016_2017 %&gt;% full_join(kelp_counts_abur, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;site&quot;)) Let’s look at the merged data frame with View(abur_kelp_join). A few things to notice about how full_join() has worked: All columns that existed in both data frames still exist. All observations are retained, even if they don’t have a match. In this case, notice that for other sites (not ‘abur’) the observation for fish still exists, even though there was no corresponding kelp data to merge with it. The kelp frond data from 2018 is also returned, even though the fish counts dataset did not have ‘year == 2018’ in it. The kelp frond data is joined to all observations where the joining variables (year, site) are a match, which is why it is repeated 5 times for each year (once for each fish species). Because all data (observations &amp; columns) are retained, full_join() is the safest option if you’re unclear about how to merge data frames. #### left_join() to merge data frames, keeping everything in the ‘x’ data frame and only matches from the ‘y’ data frame Now, we want to keep all observations in fish_2016_2017, and merge them with kelp_counts_abur while only keeping observations from kelp_counts_abur that match an observation within fish_2016_2017. So when we use left_join(), any information on kelp counts from 2018 should be dropped. fish_kelp_2016_2017 &lt;- fish_2016_2017 %&gt;% left_join(kelp_counts_abur) ## Joining, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;site&quot;) Notice when you look at fish_kelp_2016_2017, the 2018 data that does exist in kelp_counts_abur does not get joined to the fish_2016_2017 data frame, because left_join(df_a, df_b) will only keep observations from df_b if they have a match in df_a! 9.2.3.2 inner_join() to merge data frames, only keeping observations with a match in both When we used left_join(df_a, df_b), we kept all observations in df_a but only observations from df_b that matched an entry in df_a (in other words, some entries from df_b were excluded). Use inner_join() if you know that you only want to retain observations when they match across both data frames. Caution: this is built to exclude any observations that don’t match across data frames by joined variables - double check to make sure this is actually what you want to do! For example, if we use inner_join() to merge fish_counts and kelp_counts_abur, then we are asking R to only return observations where the joining variables (year and site) have matches in both data frames. Let’s see what the outcome is: abur_kelp_inner_join &lt;- fish_counts %&gt;% inner_join(kelp_counts_abur) ## Joining, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;site&quot;) abur_kelp_inner_join ## # A tibble: 15 x 6 ## year site common_name total_count month total_fronds ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2016 abur black surfperch 2 7 307 ## 2 2016 abur blacksmith 1 7 307 ## 3 2016 abur garibaldi 1 7 307 ## 4 2016 abur rock wrasse 2 7 307 ## 5 2016 abur senorita 58 7 307 ## 6 2017 abur black surfperch 4 7 604 ## 7 2017 abur blacksmith 1 7 604 ## 8 2017 abur garibaldi 1 7 604 ## 9 2017 abur rock wrasse 57 7 604 ## 10 2017 abur senorita 64 7 604 ## 11 2018 abur black surfperch 1 7 3532 ## 12 2018 abur blacksmith 1 7 3532 ## 13 2018 abur garibaldi 1 7 3532 ## 14 2018 abur rock wrasse 1 7 3532 ## 15 2018 abur senorita 1 7 3532 Here, we see that only observations where there is a match for year and site in both data frames are returned. 9.2.3.3 *_join() in a sequence We can also merge data frames as part of a sequence of wrangling steps. As an example: Starting with the invert_counts data frame, we want to: First, use pivot_longer() to get year and counts each into a single column Convert the class of year to numeric (so it can join with another numeric year variable) Then, only keep observations for “california spiny lobster” Next, join the kelp_counts_abur to the resulting subset above, only keeping observations that have a match in both data frames That might look like this: abur_lobster_kelp &lt;- invert_counts %&gt;% pivot_longer(&#39;2016&#39;:&#39;2018&#39;, names_to = &quot;year&quot;, values_to = &quot;total_counts&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %&gt;% filter(common_name == &quot;california spiny lobster&quot;) %&gt;% inner_join(kelp_counts_abur) ## Joining, by = c(&quot;month&quot;, &quot;site&quot;, &quot;year&quot;) abur_lobster_kelp ## # A tibble: 3 x 6 ## month site common_name year total_counts total_fronds ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7 abur california spiny lobster 2016 17 307 ## 2 7 abur california spiny lobster 2017 17 604 ## 3 7 abur california spiny lobster 2018 16 3532 9.2.3.3.1 Activity Now let’s combine what we’ve learned about piping, filtering and joining! Task: Complete the following as part of a single sequence (remember, check to see what you’ve produced after each step) to create a new data frame called my_fish_join: Start with fish_counts data frame Filter to only including observations for 2017 at Arroyo Burro Join the kelp_counts_abur data frame to the resulting subset using left_join() Add a new column that contains the ‘fish per kelp fronds’ density (total_count / total_fronds) Solution: Sync your project with your repo on GitHub. 9.3 Fun / kind of scary facts How is this similar to VLOOKUP in Excel? How does it differ? From Microsoft Office Support, “use VLOOKUP when you need to find things in a table or a range by row.” So, both filter() and VLOOKUP look through your data frame (or spreadsheet, in Excel) to look for observations that match your conditions. But they also differ in important ways: By default VLOOKUP looks for and returns an observation for approximate matches (and you have to change the final argument to FALSE to look for an exact match). In contrast, by default filter() will look for exact conditional matches. VLOOKUP will look for and return information from the first observation that matches (or approximately matches) a condition. filter() will return all observations (rows) that exactly match a condition. 9.4 Interludes (deep thoughts/openscapes) Not overusing the pipe in really long sequences. What are other options? Why is that a concern? What are some ways to always know that what’s happening in a sequence is what you EXPECT is happening in a sequence? tidylog, check intermediate data frames, sometimes write intermediate data frames, etc. The risk of partial joins (&amp; a case for full_join + drop_na instead?) 9.5 Efficiency Tips Comment out multiline code with Command + Shift + C Knit with Command + Shift + K "],

We’ll create a new GitHub repo and R project, wrangle and visualize data from spreadsheets in R Markdown, communicate between RStudio (locally) and GitHub (remotely) to keep our updates safe, then share our outputs in a nicely formatted GitHub ReadMe. And we’ll learn a few new things along the way! Grolemund &amp; Wickham R4DS Illustration 10.2 Objectives Create a new repo on GitHub Start a new R project, connected to the repo Create a new R Markdown document Attach necessary packages (googlesheets4, tidyverse, here) Use here::here() for simpler (and safer) file paths Read in data from a Google sheet with the googlesheets4 package in R Basic data wrangling (dplyr, tidyr, etc.) Data visualization (ggplot2) Publish with a useful ReadMe to share 10.3 Resources The here package googlesheets4 information Project oriented workflows by Jenny Bryan 10.4 Lesson 10.4.1 Set-up: Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository called sea-creature-synthesis Clone the repo to create a version controlled project (remember, copy &amp; paste the URL from the GitHub Clone / Download) In the local project folder, create a subfolder called ‘data’ Copy and paste the fish_counts_curated.csv and lobster_counts.csv into the ‘data’ subfolder Create a new R Markdown document within your sea-creature-synthesis project Knit your .Rmd to html, saving as sb_sea_creatures.Rmd 10.4.2 Attach packages and read in the data Attach (load) packages with library(): library(tidyverse) library(googlesheets4) library(here) library(janitor) Now we’ll read in our files with readr::read_csv(), but our files aren’t in our project root. They’re in the data subfolder. Use here::here() to direct R where to look for files, if they’re not in the project root. Not sure where that is? Type here() in the Console, and it will tell you! here::here() &quot;/returns/your/project/root/&quot; Go ahead, find your project root! Then use here::here() again to easily locate a file somewhere outside of the exact project root. In our case, the files we want to read in are in the data subfolder - so we have to tell R how to get there from the root: # Read in CSV files fish_counts &lt;- readr::read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;fish_counts_curated.csv&quot;)) lobster_counts &lt;- readr::read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;lobster_counts.csv&quot;)) Check out the two data frames (fish_counts and lobster_counts). The fish_counts data frame is in pretty good shape. But the lobster_counts df could use some love, because there are “-99999” entries indicating NA values, and the column names would be difficult to write code with. When reading in the lobster data, let’s: convert every “-99999” to an NA get the column names into lower snake case using janitor::clean_names() lobster_counts &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;curation&quot;, &quot;lobster_counts.csv&quot;), na = &quot;-99999&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() Look at it again to check (always look at your data) - now both data frames seem pretty coder-friendly to work with. 10.4.3 Data wrangling join? filter? unite/separate Read in lobster data Join with another existing data frame (or 2?)
