# Dplyr and vlookups {#vlookup}

## Summary

In previous sessions, we've learned to do some basic wrangling and find summary information with functions in the `dplyr` package, which exists within the `tidyverse`. We've used: 

- `count()`: get counts of observations for groupings we specify
- `mutate()`: **add** a new column, while keeping the existing ones
- `group_by()`: let R know that **groups** exist within the dataset, by variable(s)
- `summarize()`: calculate a value (that you specify) for each group, then report each group's value in a table

In this session, we'll expand our data wrangling toolkit using: 

- `filter()` to conditionally subset our data by **rows**, and
- `*_join()` functions to merge data frames together

The combination of `filter()` and `*_join()` - to return rows satisfying a condition we specify, and merging data frames by like variables - is analogous to the useful VLOOKUP function in Excel. 

### Objectives

- Use `filter()` to subset data frames, returning **rows** that satisfy variable conditions
- Use `full_join()`, `left_join()`, and `inner_join()` to merge data frames, with different endpoints in mind
- Use `filter()` and `*_join()` as part of a wrangling sequence

## Lessons

### Getting started - Create a new .Rmd, attach packages & get data

Create a new R Markdown document in your r-workshop project and knit to save as **filter_join.Rmd**. Remove all the example code (everything below the set-up code chunk). 

In this session, we'll use three packages: 

- `tidyverse`
- `readxl`
- `here`

Attach the packages in the setup code chunk in your .Rmd:
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here) # They won't have this (files directly in top WD)

# Read in the data
invert_counts <- read_excel(here("curation","invert_counts_curated.xlsx"))
fish_counts <- read_csv(here("curation", "fish_counts_curated.csv"))
kelp_counts_abur <- read_excel(here("curation","kelp_counts_curated.xlsx"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Attach packages:
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```

Then create a new code chunk to read in three files from your 'data' subfolder:

- invert_counts_curated.xlsx
- fish_counts_curated.csv
- kelp_counts_curated.xlsx
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Read in data: 
invert_counts <- read_excel(here("data", "invert_counts_curated.xlsx"))
fish_counts <- read_csv(here("data", "fish_counts_curated.csv"))
kelp_counts_abur <- read_excel(here("data", "kelp_counts_curated.xlsx"))

```

We should always explore the data we've read in using functions like `View()`, `names()`, `summary()`, `head()` and `tail()` to ensure that the data we *think* we've read in is *actually* the data we've read in. 

Now, let's use `filter()` to decide which observations (rows) we'll keep or exclude in new subsets, similar to using Excel's VLOOKUP function.

### `filter()` to conditionally subset by rows

Use `filter()` to let R know which **rows** you want to keep or exclude, based whether or not their contents match conditions that you set for one or more variables. 

![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-filter.png)

Some examples in words that might inspire you to use `filter()`: 

- "I only want to keep rows where the temperature is greater than 90&deg;F."
- "I want to keep all observations **except** those where the tree type is listed as **unknown**."
- "I want to make a new subset with only data for mountain lions (the species variable) in California (the state variable)."

When we use `filter()`, we need to let R know a couple of things:

- What data frame we're filtering from
- What condition(s) we want observations to **match** and/or **not match** in order to keep them in the new subset

Here, we'll learn some common ways to use `filter()`.

#### Filter rows by matching a single character string

Let's say we want to keep all observations from the fish_counts data frame where the common name is "garibaldi." Here, we need to tell R to only *keep rows* from the **fish_counts** data frame when the common name (**common_name** variable) exactly matches **garibaldi**. 
Use `==` to ask R to look for matching strings:

```{r, include = FALSE}
fish_garibaldi <- filter(fish_counts, common_name == "garibaldi")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_garibaldi <- filter(fish_counts, common_name == "garibaldi")
```

Check out the **fish_garibaldi** object to ensure that only *garibaldi* observations remain. 

You could also do this using the pipe operator `%>%`: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_garibaldi <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(common_name == "garibaldi")
```

#### Activity

**Task**: Create a subset from the **fish_counts** data frame, stored as object **fish_abur**, that only contains observations from Arroyo Burro (site 'abur'). 

**Solution**: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}

fish_abur <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(site == "abur")

```

Explore the subset you just created to ensure that only Arroyo Burro observations are returned. 

#### Filter rows based on numeric conditions

Use expected operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==) to set conditions for a numeric variable when filtering. For this example, we only want to retain observations when the **total_count** column value is >= 50:

```{r, include = FALSE}
fish_over50 <- filter(fish_counts, total_count >= 50)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_over50 <- filter(fish_counts, total_count >= 50)
```

Or, using the pipe: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_over50 <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(total_count >= 50)
```

#### Filter to return rows that match *this* OR *that* OR *that*

What if we want to return a subset of the fish_counts df that contains *garibaldi*, *blacksmith* OR *black surfperch*?

There are several ways to write an "OR" statement for filtering, which will keep any observations that match Condition A *or* Condition B *or* Condition C. In this example, we will create a subset from **fish_counts** that only contains rows where the **common_name** is *garibaldi* or *blacksmith* or *black surfperch*.

Use `%in%` to ask R to look for *any matches* within a combined vector of strings: 

```{r, include = FALSE}
fish_3sp <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(common_name %in% c("garibaldi", "blacksmith", "black surfperch"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_3sp <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(common_name %in% c("garibaldi", "blacksmith", "black surfperch"))
```

Alternatively, you can indicate **OR** using the vertical line operator `|` to do the same thing (but you can see that it's more repetitive when looking for matches within the same variable): 
```{r, eval = FALSE}

fish_3sp <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(common_name == "garibaldi" | common_name == "blacksmith" | common_name == "black surfperch")

```

#### Filter to return rows that match conditions for multiple variables

In the previous examples, we set filter conditions based on a single variable (e.g. common_name). What if we want to return observations that satisfy conditions for multiple variables? 

For example: We want to create a subset that only returns rows from 'invert_counts' where the **site** is "abur" or "mohk" *and* the **common_name** is "purple urchin." In `filter()`, add a comma (or ampersand, &) between arguments for multiple *AND* conditions:

```{r, include = FALSE}
urchin_abur_mohk <- invert_counts %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("abur","mohk"), common_name == "purple urchin")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
urchin_abur_mohk <- invert_counts %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("abur","mohk"), common_name == "purple urchin")
```

```{r}
head(urchin_abur_mohk)
```

Like most things in R, there are other ways to do the same thing. For example, you could do the same thing using `&` (instead of a comma) between "and" conditions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Use the ampersand (&) to add another condition "and this must be true":

urchin_abur_mohk <- invert_counts %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("abur","mohk") & common_name == "purple urchin")
```

Or you could just do two filter steps in sequence: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Written as sequential filter steps:

urchin_abur_mohk <- invert_counts %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("abur", "mohk")) %>% 
  filter(common_name == "purple urchin")
```

##### Activity: combined filter conditions

**Task:** Create a subset from the **fish_counts** data frame, called **low_gb_wr** that only contains:

- Observations of *garibaldi* and *rock wrasse*
- Where the *total_count* is *less than or equal to 10*

**Solution:**
```{r, eval = FALSE}

low_gb_wr <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(common_name %in% c("garibaldi", "rock wrasse"), 
         total_count <= 10)
```

#### Filter to return rows that *do not* match conditions

Sometimes we might want to exclude observations. Here, let's say we want to make a subset that contains all rows from **fish_counts** except those recorded at the Mohawk Reef site ("mohk" in the *site* variable). 

We use `!=` to return observations that **do not match** a condition. 

Like this: 
```{r, include = FALSE}
fish_no_mohk <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(site != "mohk")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_no_mohk <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(site != "mohk")
```

This similarly works to exclude observations by a value. 

For example, if we want to return all observations *except* those where the total fish count is 1, we use:
```{r, include = FALSE}
fish_more_one <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(total_count != 1)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_more_one <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(total_count != 1)
```

What if we want to exclude observations for multiple conditions? For example, here we want to return all rows where the fish species **is not** garibaldi **or** rock wrasse. 

We can use `filter(!variable %in% c("apple", "orange"))` to return rows where the variable does **not** match "apple" or "orange". For our fish example, that looks like this: 

```{r, include = FALSE}
fish_subset <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(!common_name %in% c("garibaldi", "rock wrasse"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fish_subset <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(!common_name %in% c("garibaldi", "rock wrasse"))
```

Which then only returns observations for the other fish species in the dataset. 
```{r}
head(fish_subset)
```

#### Example: combining `filter()` with other functions using the pipe operator (`%>%`)

We can also use `filter()` in combination with the functions we previously learned for wrangling. If we have multiple sequential steps to perform, we can string them together using the *pipe operator* (`%>%`).

Here, we'll start with the `invert_counts` data frame and create a subset that:

- Converts to long(er) format with `pivot_longer()`
- Only keeps observations for rock scallops
- Calculates the total count of rock scallops by site only

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Counts of scallops by site (all years included):

scallop_count_by_site <- invert_counts %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = '2016':'2018', 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "sp_count") %>% 
  filter(common_name == "rock scallop") %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(tot_count = sum(sp_count, na.rm = TRUE))
  
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Counts of scallops by site (all years included):
scallop_count_by_site <- invert_counts %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = '2016':'2018', 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "sp_count") %>% 
  filter(common_name == "rock scallop") %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(tot_count = sum(sp_count, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
scallop_count_by_site
```

### Merging data frames with `*_join()` 

Excel's `VLOOKUP` can also be used to merge data from separate tables or worksheets. Here, we'll use the `*_join()` functions to merge separate data frames in R. 

There are a number of ways to merge data frames in R. We'll use `full_join()`, `left_join()`, and `inner_join()` in this session. 

From R Documentation (`?join`): 

- `full_join()`: "returns all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing." Basically, nothing gets thrown out, even if a match doesn't exist - making `full_join()` the safest option for merging data frames. When in doubt, `full_join()`.

- `left_join()`: "return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned."

- `inner_join()`: "returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned." This will drop observations that don't have a match between the merged data frames, which makes it a riskier merging option if you're not sure what you're trying to do. 

Schematic (from RStudio data wrangling cheat sheet): 
![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-combine-options1.png)

To clarify what the different joins are doing, let's first make a subset of the *fish_counts* data frame that only contains observations from 2016 and 2017. 

```{r}
fish_2016_2017 <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(year == 2016 | year == 2017)
```

Take a look to ensure that only those years are included with `View(fish_2016_2017)`. Now, let's merge it with our kelp fronds data in different ways. 

#### `full_join()` to merge data frames, keeping everything

When we join data frames in R, we need to tell R a couple of things (and it does the hard joining work for us):

- Which data frames we want to merge together
- Which variables to merge by

**Note:** If there are **exactly matching** column names in the data frames you're merging, the `*_join()` functions will assume that you want to join by those columns. If there are *no* matching column names, you can specify which columns to join by manually. We'll do both here. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Join the fish_counts and kelp_counts_abur together: 
abur_kelp_join <- fish_2016_2017 %>% 
  full_join(kelp_counts_abur, by = c("year", "site")) # Uh oh. An error message.

```

When we try to do that join, we get an error message: 
`Error: Can't join on 'year' x 'year' because of incompatible types (character / numeric)`

Let's google this. That means copying this from the console and pasting it into Google. 

What's going on here? First, there's something fishy (ha) going on with the class of the *year* variable in `kelp_counts_abur`. Use the `class()` function to see how R understands that variable (remember, we use `$` to return a specific column from a data frame). 

```{r}
class(kelp_counts_abur$year)
```

So the variable is currently stored as a character. Why? 

If we go back to the kelp_counts_curated.xlsx file, we'll see that the numbers in both the year and month column have been stored as *text*. There are several hints Excel gives us: 

- Cells are left aligned, when values stored as numbers are right aligned
- The green triangles in the corner indicate some formatting
- The warning sign shows up when you click on one of the values with text formatting, and lets you know that the cell has been stored as text. We are given the option to reformat as numeric in Excel, but we'll do it here in R so we have a reproducible record of the change to the variable class. 

There are a number of ways to do this in R. We'll use `mutate()` to overwrite the existing `year` column while coercing it to class *numeric* using the `as.numeric()` function. 

```{r}
# Coerce the class of 'year' to numeric
kelp_counts_abur <- kelp_counts_abur %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

Now if we check the class of the *year* variable in `kelp_counts_abur`, we'll see that it has been coerced to 'numeric':
```{r}
class(kelp_counts_abur$year)
```

**Question: Isn't it bad practice to overwrite variables, instead of just making a new one?** Great question, and usually the answer is yes. Here, we feel fine with "overwriting" the year column because we're not changing anything about what's contained within the column, we're only changing how R understands it. Always use caution if overwriting variables, and if in doubt, add one instead! 

OK, so now the class of *year* in the data frames we're joining is the same. Let's try that `full_join()` again:

```{r}
abur_kelp_join <- fish_2016_2017 %>% 
  full_join(kelp_counts_abur, by = c("year", "site"))
```

Let's look at the merged data frame with `View(abur_kelp_join)`. A few things to notice about how `full_join()` has worked: 

1. All columns that existed in **both data frames** still exist.
2. All observations are retained, even if they don't have a match. In this case, notice that for other sites (not 'abur') the observation for fish still exists, even though there was no corresponding kelp data to merge with it. The kelp frond data from 2018 is also returned, even though the fish counts dataset did not have 'year == 2018' in it.
3. The kelp frond data is joined to *all observations* where the joining variables (*year*, *site*) are a match, which is why it is repeated 5 times for each year (once for each fish species).

Because all data (observations & columns) are retained, `full_join()` is the safest option if you're unclear about how to merge data frames. 
#### `left_join()` to merge data frames, keeping everything in the 'x' data frame and only matches from the 'y' data frame

Now, we want to keep all observations in *fish_2016_2017*, and merge them with *kelp_counts_abur* while only keeping observations from *kelp_counts_abur* that match an observation within *fish_2016_2017*. So when we use `left_join()`, any information on kelp counts from 2018 should be dropped. 

```{r}
fish_kelp_2016_2017 <- fish_2016_2017 %>% 
  left_join(kelp_counts_abur)
```

Notice when you look at `fish_kelp_2016_2017`, the 2018 data that **does** exist in `kelp_counts_abur` does **not** get joined to the `fish_2016_2017` data frame, because `left_join(df_a, df_b)` will only keep observations from `df_b` if they have a match in `df_a`! 

#### `inner_join()` to merge data frames, only keeping observations with a match in **both**

When we used `left_join(df_a, df_b)`, we kept all observations in `df_a` but *only observations from `df_b` that matched an entry in `df_a`* (in other words, some entries from `df_b` were excluded).

Use `inner_join()` if you know that you **only** want to retain observations when they match across **both data** frames. Caution: this is built to exclude any observations that don't match across data frames by joined variables - double check to make sure this is actually what you want to do! 

For example, if we use `inner_join()` to merge fish_counts and kelp_counts_abur, then we are asking R to **only return observations where the joining variables (*year* and *site*) have matches in both data frames.** Let's see what the outcome is: 
```{r}
abur_kelp_inner_join <- fish_counts %>% 
  inner_join(kelp_counts_abur)

abur_kelp_inner_join
```

Here, we see that only observations where there is a match for *year* and *site* in both data frames are returned.

#### `*_join()` in a sequence

We can also merge data frames as part of a sequence of wrangling steps. 

As an example: Starting with the `invert_counts` data frame, we want to:

- First, use `pivot_longer()` to get year and counts each into a single column
- Convert the class of *year* to numeric (so it can join with another numeric year variable)
- Then, only keep observations for "california spiny lobster"
- Next, join the `kelp_counts_abur` to the resulting subset above, **only keeping observations that have a match in both data frames**

That might look like this: 

```{r}

abur_lobster_kelp <- invert_counts %>% 
  pivot_longer('2016':'2018', names_to = "year", values_to = "total_counts") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  filter(common_name == "california spiny lobster") %>% 
  inner_join(kelp_counts_abur)

```

```{r}
abur_lobster_kelp
```

##### Activity 

Now let's combine what we've learned about piping, filtering and joining!

**Task:** Complete the following as part of a single sequence (remember, check to see what you've produced after each step) to create a new data frame called `my_fish_join`:

- Start with `fish_counts` data frame
- Filter to only including observations for 2017 at Arroyo Burro
- Join the `kelp_counts_abur` data frame to the resulting subset using `left_join()`
- Add a new column that contains the 'fish per kelp fronds' density (total_count / total_fronds)

**Solution:**
```{r, include = FALSE}

my_fish_join <- fish_counts %>% 
  filter(year == 2017, site == "abur") %>% 
  left_join(kelp_counts_abur) %>% 
  mutate(fish_per_frond = total_count / total_fronds)

```

**Sync your project with your repo on GitHub.**

## Fun / kind of scary facts

**How is this similar to `VLOOKUP` in Excel? How does it differ?**

From [Microsoft Office Support](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1), "use VLOOKUP when you need to find things in a table or a range by row." 

So, both `filter()` and `VLOOKUP` look through your data frame (or spreadsheet, in Excel) to look for observations that match your conditions. But they also differ in important ways:

(1) By default `VLOOKUP` looks for and returns an observation for *approximate* matches (and you have to change the final argument to FALSE to look for an exact match). In contrast, by default `filter()` will look for exact conditional matches. 

(2) `VLOOKUP` will look for and return information from the *first observation* that matches (or approximately matches) a condition. `filter()` will return all observations (rows) that exactly match a condition. 

## Interludes (deep thoughts/openscapes)

- Not overusing the pipe in really long sequences. What are other options? Why is that a concern? What are some ways to always know that what's happening in a sequence is what you EXPECT is happening in a sequence? tidylog, check intermediate data frames, sometimes write intermediate data frames, etc. 

- The risk of partial joins (& a case for full_join + drop_na instead?)
